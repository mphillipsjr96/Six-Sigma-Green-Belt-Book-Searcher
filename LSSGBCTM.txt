  Unit 1:
 Introduction
 to Six Sigma
  Chapter 1: What is 
Six
 Sigma?
  Six Sigma, or 6
, is
 both a methodology for process improvement and a statistical concept that seeks to 
define the variation inherent in any process. The overarching premise of Six Sigma is that variation in a 
process leads t
o opportunities for error; opportunities for error then lead to risks for product defects. 
Product defects
Šwhether in a tangible process or a service
Šlead to poor customer satisfaction. By 
working to reduce variation and opportunities for error, the Six Si
gma method ultimately reduces 
process costs and increases customer satisfaction.
 Data Driven Processes and Decisions
 In applying Six Sigma, organizations, teams, and project managers seek to implement strategies that are 
based on measurement and metrics. 
Historically, many business leaders made decisions based on 
intuition or experience. Despite some common beliefs in various industries, Six Sigma doesn™t remove 
the need for experienced leadership, and it doesn™t negate the importance of intuition in any p
rocess. 
Instead, Six Sigma works alongside other skills, experience, and knowledge to provide a mathematical 
and statistical foundation for decision making. Experience might say a process isn™t working; statistics 
prove that to be true. Intuition might gui
de a project manager to believe a certain change could improve 
output; Six Sigma tools help organizations validate those assumptions.
 Decision Making Without Six Sigma
 Without proper measurement and analysis, 
decision making processes in an organization
 might 
proceed as follows:
  Someone with clout in the organization has 

a good idea or takes interest in someone 
else™s idea.
  Based on past experience or knowledge, 
decision makers within an organization 
believe the idea will be successful.
  The idea is imple
mented; sometimes it is 
implemented in beta mode so expenses 
and risks are minimized.
  The success of the idea is weighed after 
implementation; problems are addressed 
after they impact products or processes in 
some way in the present or the future.
 What is beta testing?
 Beta testing is the act of implementing a new 

idea, system, or 
product with a select group of 
people or processes in as controlled an 
environment as possible. After beta testers 
identify potential problems and those 
problems are corrected, the idea, system, or 
product can be rolled out to the entire 
population of cust
omers, employees, or 
processes. The purpose of beta testing is to 

reduce the risks and costs inherent in 
launching an unproven product or system to a 
widespread audience.

 Beta tes
ting is sometimes used in a Six Sigma approach, but the idea or change in question goes through 
rigorous analysis and data testing first. The disadvantage of launching ideas into beta
Šor to an entire 
population
--without going through a Six Sigma methodolog
y is that organizations can experience 
unintended consequences from changes, spend money on ideas that don™t end up working out as 
planned, and impact customer perceptions through trial
-and
-error periods rife with opportunities for 
error. In many cases, or
ganizations that don™t rely on data make improvements without first 
understanding the true gain or loss associated with the change
. Some improvements may appear to 
work on the surface without actually impacting customer satisfaction or profit in a positive
 way.
 Decision Making With Six Sigma
 The Six Sigma method lets organizations identify problems, validate assumptions, brainstorm solutions, 
and plan for implementation to avoid unintended consequences. By applying tools such as statistical 

analysis and pro
cess mapping to problems and solutions, teams can visualize and predict outcomes with 
a high
-level of accuracy, letting leadership make decisions with less financial risk.
 Six Sigma methods don™t offer a crystal ball for organizations, though. Even with ex
pert use of the tools 
described in this book, problems can arise for teams as they implement and maintain solutions. That™s 

why Six Sigma also provides for control methods: once teams implement changes, they can control 
processes for a fraction of the cost
 of traditional quality methods by continuing the use of Six Sigma 
tools and statistics.
 Defining 6
Six Sigma as a methodology for process improvement involves a vast library of tools and knowledge, 
which will be covered throughout this book. In this sect
ion, we™ll begin to define the statistical concept 
represented by 6
At the most basic definition, 6
is a statistical representation for what many experts call a ﬁperfectﬂ 
process. Technically, in a Six Sigma process, there are only 3.4 defects per milli
on opportunities. In 
percentages, that means 99.99966 percent of the products from a Six Sigma process are without defect. 
At just one sigma level below
Š5, or 99.97 percent accuracy
--processes experience 233 errors per 
million opportunities. In simpler te
rms, there are going to be many more unsatisfied customers.
 Real World Examples
 According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, air traffic controllers in the United 
States handle 28,537 commercial flights daily.
1 In a year, that is approximately 10.416 million flights. 
Based on a Five Sigma air traffic control process, errors of some type occur in the process for handling 

approximately 2,426 flights every year. With a Six Sigma process, that risk drops to 35.41 er
rors.
 The CDC reports that approximately 51.4 million surgeries are performed in the United States in a given  
year.
2 Based on a 99.97 accuracy rate, doctors would make errors in 11,976 surgeries each year, or 230 
surgeries a week. At Six Sigma, that drops
 to approximately 174 errors a year for the entire country, or

                                                            just over 3 errors each week. At Five Sigma, patients are 68 times more likely to experience an error at 
the hands of medical providers.
 While most people accept a 99.9 percent accuracy rate in
 even the most critical services on a daily basis, 
the above examples highlight how wide the gap between Six Sigma and Five Sigma really is. For 

organizations, it™s not just about the error rate
Šit™s also about the costs associated with each error. 
 Consid
er an example based on Amazon shipments.
 On Cyber Monday in 2013, Amazon processed a 
whopping 36.8 million orders.
3 Let™s assume that each order error costs the company an average of $35 
(a very conservative number, considering that costs might include ret
urn shipping, labor to answer 
customer phone calls or emails, and labor and shipping to right a wrong order).

  For this example, the cost difference in sigma levels is still over $295,000 for the Cyber Monday 
business. 
 For most 
organizations, Six Sigma processes are a constant target. Achieving and maintaining Six Sigma 
ﬁperfectionﬂ is difficult and requires continuous process improvement. But even advancing from lower 

levels of sigma to a Four or Five Sigma process has a drastic
 impact on costs and customer satisfaction. 
Let™s look at the Amazon Cyber Monday example at other levels of sigma.

  At very low levels of sigma, any process is 
unlikely to be profitable
. The higher the sigma level, the better 
the bottom line is likely to be.
 Calculating Sigma Level
 Organizations and teams can calculate the sigma level of a product or process using the equation below:
          X  100
  = Yield
  Consider a process in a marketing department that distributes letters to customers or prospects. For the 
purposes of the example, imagine that the process inserts 30,000 letters in preaddressed envelo
pes 
each day. In a given business week, the process outputs 150,000 letters.
 The marketing department begins receiving complaints that people are receiving letters in envelopes 

that are addressed to them, but the letters inside are addressed to or relevant
 to someone else. The 
marketing department randomly selects 1,000 letters from the next week™s batch and finds that 5 of 
them have errors. Applying that to the total amount, they estimate that as many as 750 letters could 
have errors. (Sampling and extrapo
lation are covered in depth in the advanced chapters on statistics.)
 The letter process has 150,000 opportunities for error each week and an estimated 750 defects. 
  ((150,000 
Œ 750) / 150,000) * 100 =  a yield of 99.5
 Look up a yield of 99.5 in the abridg
ed Sigma table below and you™ll see the process described above is 

currently between 4 and 4.1 sigma.

 Sigma Level Is Not a Final Indicator
 Sigma levels provide organization with a high
-level look at how a process is performing, but comparing 
sigma levels between multiple proce
sses doesn™t always point to the particular process an organization 
should improve first. Leadership should also consider costs, resources, and the estimated impact of 
improvements.

 For example, consider these processes that might be found in a food proces
sing plant:
 Process
 Performance Metric(s)
 Current Sigma Level
 Attaching a decorative element 
to food item
 Decorative touch is centered on 
food product and stable so it 
won™t fall off in transit
 2.2
 Packing product
 Product is sealed for freshness
 3.1
 Shi
pping of product
 Product reaches the right 
customer in a timely manner
 4.3
  A glance at sigma levels indicates that the process that attaches the decorative element is in most need 
of improvement. While that process has the highest rate of defects, 
leadership within the plant would 
have to ask themselves: How much does that matter to the customer, and what is the hit to the bottom 
line?
 It™s likely that most customers will notice most that the product is sealed for freshness and reaches the 

right loc
ation. Since bad product has to be thrown away, the most expensive errors might be associated 
with improper sealing during packing. The plant is likely to use resources to improve the packing process 

before addressing the decorative element issue.
 After th
e packing process is improved, the plant might then consider whether to improve the decorating 
process or the shipping process. As part of that consideration, the company might conduct customer 
surveys to reveal that some customers have stopped buying the 
product because of the decorative 
element issue. An analyst estimates that the loss of sales related to that issue are costing the company 
$1,000 a week. Shipping issues are costing the company $500 a week.
 Should the company address the costlier issue fir
st? What if you were told that the shipping process 
could be improved with staff training sessions
, while the decorative element issue required an expensive 
machinery update?
 Sometimes, organizations have to consider the expense of an improvement
. Applying
 a Six Sigma project to all situations isn™t financially lucrative since those improvements take 
time and money. A Six Sigma culture is about continuous improvement, which means teams consider all 

options before embarking on the most lucrative improvement 
measures.
 Common Six Sigma Principles
 Organizations can impact their sigma level by integrating core principles from the Six Sigma 

methodology into leadership styles, process management, and improvement endeavors. The principles 

of Six Sigma, and the tools
 used to achieve them, are covered in detail in various sections of this book, 
but some common ideas are introduced below.
 Customer
-Focused Improvement
 In the illustration about the food plant, we saw that the Six Sigma process doesn™t just make 

improvemen
ts for the sake of driving up sigma levels. A primary principle of the methodology is a focus 
on the customer. In 
Chapter 5, we™ll look at the Voice of the Customer
 (VoC) and ways for establishing

 what the customer really wants from a product or process. B
y combining that knowledge with 
measurements, statistics, and process improvement methods, organizations increase customer 
satisfaction, ultimately bolstering profits, customer retention, and loyalty.
 A detailed understanding of the customer and customer d
esires not only let
s businesses customize 
product offerings and services, but it also lets organizations:
  Offer additional features customers want and are willing to pay for
  Prioritize product development to meet current needs
  Develop new ideas based on cu
stomer feedback
  Understand changing trends in the market
  Identify areas of concern
  Prioritize work on challenges based on how customers perceive various problems or issues
  Test solutions and ideas before investing time and money in them
 Value 
Streams
 The
 value stream is the sequence of all items, events, and people required to produce an 
end result. For example, the value stream for serving a hotdog with ketchup to someone would include:
  A hotdog supplier
  A bun supplier
  A ketchup supplier
  Hotdogs
  Buns
  Ketchup
  A cooking procedure for the hotdog 
  A pot
  Tongs
  Someone to do the cooking
  A plate
  Someone to put the hotdog into the bun
  Someone to put the ketchup on the hotdog
  Someone to put the completed hotdog onto a plate
  Someone to serve the hot
dog to another
 If you combine all of the above processes into a pictorial representation of exactly how these elements 
become the served hotdog, then you have a value stream map
. The purpose for dete
rmining a value stream for a process is that you can identify areas of concern, 
waste, and improvement. In the above process, are there four different people putting the hotdog 
together and serving it, or is one person doing all four of those tasks? Is the
 supplier a single grocery 
store, or are you shopping for items at various stores and why? Do you get savings benefits to offset the 
added time spent working with multiple suppliers? These are some examples of the questions you can 

reveal and answer during
 value stream mapping.

 Continuous Process Improvement
 Inherent in the Six Sigma method is 
continuous
 process improvement. An organization that completely 
adopts a Six Sigma methodology never stops improving. It identifies and prioritizes areas of opportuni
ty 
on a continuous basis. Once one area is improved upon, the organization moves on to improving 
another area. If a process is improved from 4 Sigma to 4.4 Sigma, the organization considers ways to 

move the sigma level up further. The goal is to move ever 
closer to the ﬁperfectﬂ level of 99.99966 
accuracy for all processes within an organization while maintaining other goals and requirements, such 

as financial stability, as quickly as possible.
 Variation
 One of the ways to continuously improve a process is 
to reduce the variation in the process. Every 
process contains inherent variation: 
in a call center with 20 employees, variation will exist in each phone 
call even if the calls are scripted. Inflection, accents, environmental concerns, and caller moods are
 just 
some things that lead to variation in this circumstance. By providing employees with a script or 
suggested comments for common scenarios, the call center reduces variation to some degree.
 Consider another example: A
 pizzeria. The employees are instru
cted to use certain amounts of 
ingredients for each size of pizza. A small gets one cup of cheese; a large gets two cups. The pizzeria 

owner notes a great deal of variation in how much cheese 
is 
on each pizza, and he fears it will lead to 
inconsistent cust
omer experiences. To reduce variation, he provides employees with two measuring 
cups: a 1
-cup container for small pizzas and a 2
-cup container for large pizzas. 
 The variation is reduced, but it is still present. Some employees pour cheese into the cups an
d some 
scoop it. Some fill the cups just to the 
rim;
 others let the cheese create a mound above the rim. The 
owner acts to reduce variation again: he trains all employees to fill the cup over the rim and use a flat 
spatula to scrape excess cheese off. 
While variation will still exist due to factors such as air pockets or 
how cheese settles in the cup, it is greatly reduced
, and customers experience more consistent pizzas.
 Removing Waste
 Remember the hotdog example for value streams? We asked the question: 
do 
four different people act 
to place the hotdog in the bun, put the ketchup on the hotdog, plate the hotd
og, and serve it? If so, 
does the process take more time because the product has to be transferred between four people? 
Would it be faster to have one person perform all those actions? If so, then we™ve identified some waste 
in the process
Šin this case, wa
ste of conveyance. 
 Removing waste
Šitems, actions, or people that are unnecessary to the outcome of a process
Šreduces 
processing time, opportunities for errors, and overall costs. While waste is a major concern in the Six 
Sigma methodology, the concept of 
waste comes from a methodology known as Lean Process 
Management.
. Equipping People
 Implementing improved processes is a temporary measure unless organizations equip their employees 
working with processes to monitor and maintain improvements. In most organizations, process 

improvement includes a two
-pronged approach. First, a process impr
ovement team comprised of 
project management, methodology experts, and subject
-matter experts define, plan, and implement an 
improvement. That team then equips the employees who work directly with the process daily to control 

and manage the process in its 
improved state.

 Controlling the Process 
 Often, Six Sigma improvements address processes that are out of control. Out of control processes meet 
specific statistical requirements
. The goal of improvement is to bring a pro
cess back within a state of 
statistical control
. Then,
 after improvements are implemented, measurements, statistics, and other Six 
Sigma tools are used to ensure the process remains in control. Part of any continuous improvement 

process is ensuring such co
ntrols are put in place and that the employees who are hands
-on with the 
process on a regular basis know how to use the controls.
 Challenges of Six Sigma
 Six Sigma is not without its own challenges. As an expansive method that requires commitment to 
contin
uous improvement, Six Sigma is often viewed as an expensive or unnecessary process, especially 
for small or mid
-sized organizations. Leadership at Ideal Aerosmith, a manufacturing and engineering 
company in Minnesota, was skeptical of Six Sigma ideas and t
he costs associated with implementing 
them. Despite reservations, the company waded into Six Sigma implementations, eventually seeing 

worthwhile results after only 18 months. Those results included a production improvement of 25 
percent, a 5 percent improv
ement in profits within the first year, and a 30 percent improvement in 
timely deliverables.
4  Some obstacles and challenges that often stand in the way of positive results from Six Sigma include lack 

of support, resources, or knowledge, poor execution of 
projects, inconsistent access to valid statistical 
data, and concerns about using the methodology in new industries.
 Lack of Support
 Six Sigma requires support and buy
-in at all levels of an organization. Leaders and executives must be 
willing to back init
iatives with resources
Šfinancial and labor related. Subject
-matter experts must be 
open to sharing information about their processes with project teams, and employees at all levels must 
embrace the idea of change and improvement and participate in training
. Common barriers to support 
include:
  Leaders that are unfamiliar with or don™t understand the Six Sigma process
  Leaders willing to pursue improvements initially but who lose interest in overseeing and 
championing projects before they are completed
  Staff t
hat is fearful of change, especially in an environment when change has historically caused 
negative consequences for employees
  Employees who are resistant to change because they believe improvements might make them 
obsolete, drastically change their jobs, 
or make their jobs harder
  Department heads or employees who constantly champion their own processes and needs and 
are unwilling to enter into big
-picture thinking 
 Lack of Resources or Knowledge
 Lack of resources can be a challenge to Six Sigma initiatives
, but they don™t have to be a barrier. Lack of 
knowledge about how to use and implement Six Sigma is one of the first issues small
- and mid
-sized 
companies face. Smaller businesses can™t always afford to hire dedicated resources to handle

s improvement, but the availability of resources and Six Sigma training makes it 
increasingly possible for organizations to use some of the tools without an expert or to send in
-house 
staff to be certified in Six Sigma.
 Poor Project Execution
 Companies imp
lementing Six Sigma for the first time, especially in a project environment, often turn 
away from the entire methodology if the first project or improvement falls flat. Proponents of Six Sigma 
within any organization really have to hit it out of the ballpa
rk with the first project if leadership and 

others are on the fence about the methodology. Teams can help avoid poor project performance by 
taking extreme care to execute every phase of the project correctly. By choosing low
-risk, high
-reward 
improvements,
 teams can also stack the deck in their favor with first
-time projects. The only 
disadvantage with such a tactic is that it can be hard to duplicate the wow factor with subsequent 
improvements, making it important to remember that long
-term implementation 
and commitment is 
vital 
in Six Sigma.
 Data Access Issues
 Data and analytics issues are a common challenge for organizations of all sizes. Gaining access to 
consistent and accurate data streams
Šand applying statistical analysis to that data in an appropr
iate 
manner
Šis difficult. Some data
-related challenges include:
  Discovering that an important process metric is not being captured
  The use of manual data processes in many processes
  Automated data processes that capture enormous amounts and create scope ch
allenges
  Data that is skewed due to assumptions, human interaction in the process, or incorrect capture
  Lengthy times between raw data capture and access
  Industry or company compliance rules that make it difficult to gain access to necessary data
 Concerns 
about Using Six Sigma in a Specific Industry
 Six Sigma originated in the manufacturing industry and many of the concepts and tools of the 

methodology are still taught in the context of a factory or industrial environment. Because of this, 
organizations oft
en discount the methods or believe they will be too difficult to implement in other 
industries. In reality, Six Sigma can be customized to any industry.

 Chapter 2: Six Sigma History and App
lica
tion
  While the roots of Six Sigma are commonly attributed to companies such as Toyota and Motorola, the 
methodology is actually grounded in concepts that date as far back as the 19
th century. Before delving 
into the history of Six Sigma, it™s important to
 understand the difference between traditional quality 
programs, such as Total Quality Management, and continuous process improvement methods, such as 
Six Sigma. 
 Most modern quality and improvement programs can be traced back to the same roots. Both quali
ty 
programs and continuous process improvement methods look to achieve goals such as reducing errors 
and defects, making processes more efficient, improving customer satisfaction, and boosting profits. But 
quality programs are concerned with achieving a sp
ecific goal. The program either runs forever, 
constantly working toward the same goal, or it achieves the end goal and must be reset for a new goal. 
 Six Sigma seeks to instill a culture of
 continuous
 improvement and quality that 
optimizes 
performance o
f an organization from the inside out. It™s the cultural element inherent in Six Sigma that lets organizations 
enact both small and sweeping improvements that drastically impact efficiencies and costs. Six Sigma 
does work toward individual goals with regar
d to each project, but the projects are part of the overall 
culture of improvement that, in practice, is never done. Six Sigma creates safeguards and tactics so that, 
even after a project is considered complete, controls are in place to ensure progress con
tinues and it is 
impossible to revert to old ways.
 The Development of Statistical Process Control
 Six Sigma applies statistics to define, 
measure, 
analyze, verify, and control processes. 
In fact, Six Sigma 
teams usually use methodologies known as DMAIC or 
DMADV to accomplish improvements and develop 
controls for processes. DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. These are the 
five phases of a Six Sigma project to improve a process that already exists. When developing a new 
process, 
teams use DMADV, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify. Both 
methods are discussed in Chapter 11, and Unit 3 provides in
-depth information about each phase of 
DMAIC.
  The roots of statistical process control, which provide a backbo
ne for Six Sigma methods, began with the 
development of the normal curve by Carl Friedrich Gauss in the 19th century. We know today that the 
normal curve is just one of several possible probability 
distribution models. It is perhaps the most widely used mo
del
, and the other models developed from the normal curve. 

Probability distribution models are discussed in later chapters 
on statistics
 In the early part of the 20th century, statistical process control 
received another big boost thanks to contributions f
rom an 
engineer and scholar named Walter Shewhart. Shewhart's 
contributions to quality are many, but two specific ideas stand out. First, Shewhart was the first person

 to closely relate sigma level and quality. He defined a process in need of correction as
 one that is 
performing at three sigma. If you look back to Chapter 1 and the theoretical Amazon example, the cost 
difference between four sigma and three sigma is over $78 million; in comparison, the difference 
between five and four sigma is only approxim
ately $7.6 million. Because errors and costs exponentially 
increase as sigma level decreases, Shewhart™s definition has very practical applications in business. 
While Six Sigma as a method seeks to move ever toward less than 3.4 defects per million opportu
nities 
(dpmo), it is also true that if the quality of a process decreases, as it approaches three sigma, the costs 
associated with errors increase substantially.
 Second, Shewhart is considered the father of control charts. Control charts, which are covered
 in depth 
in the chapters on advanced 
statistics
, are a critical component of statistical process control that lets 
organizations maintain improved performance after a Six Sigma initiative. At a time when scholars were 
writing about the theoretical applica
tion of statistics in a growing number of fields, Shewhart developed 
ways to apply these concepts to manufacturing and industrial processes specifically.
 During the same time period, W. Edwards Deming was working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A 
physicist and mathematician, Deming was in charge of teaching courses at the agency™s graduate school 
and he arranged for Shewhart to come and speak there. Later, Deming brought Shewhart's statistical 
concepts to the United States Census Bureau, applying h
is theories outside of an industrial or 
manufacturing environment for possibly the first time. 
 One of Deming™s ideas is called the PDCA cycle, or plan
-do
-check
-act cycle. The idea is that improvement 
comes when you recognize there is a need for change and
 make a plan to create improvement. Next, 
you do something by testing your ideas. Using the results of the test, you 
check or verify that your improvements are working. Then you act, bringing 
your improvements to a production environment or scaling improve
ments 
outside of the test environment. The fact that PDCA is a cycle means it never 

ends; there are always improvements to be made. This is a core 
tenet 
of Six 
Sigma. 
  Following World War II, Deming worked in Japan on behalf of the United 
States 
government in several capacities. While in post
-war Japan, Deming 
befriended statisticians and convinced at least one notable engineer that 

statistical process control was relevant to Japan's need to drastically drive economic and production 
performance to
 overcome damage from the war. In the end, Deming became a valued teacher and 
consultant to manufacturing companies in Japan, planting the ideas and concepts that would soon 
become the Toyota Production System, or Lean Six Sigma.

 Deming's teachings and the need for Japanese industry to 
make a successful comeback 
following a catastrophic war 
combined to bear fruit for Toyota. Toyota™s leadership had 
visited the concepts of quality prior to WWII, but improved 
performance and efficiency became a more critical goal given 

the nature of Japan's economy and resources in 
the 1940s 
and 50s. Taking manufacturing ideas attributed to Henry 
Ford, Toyota leaders applied statistics and new quality 
concepts to create a system they felt would increase 

production and allow for variable products while reducing 
costs and ensuring qual
ity.
 Several individuals were instrumental in the ultimate 
development of the Toyota Production System. They infused 
the process with automated machinery, quality controls to 
keep defects from occurring, and efficiency tools that had not 
yet been applied w
ith such detail and consistency. One man, 

Kiichiro Toyoda, had previous factory experience. In his 

previous jobs, he added efficiencies to processes in textile 
mills through conveyor and other automated systems. 
Toyoda introduced the same concepts on certa
in lines in the 
Toyota manufacturing process. Later, Eiji Toyoda 
and Taiichi 
Ohno
 introduced concepts known as Just
-in-Time and 
jidoka
, which are the pillars of the Toyota 
Production System.
 The principles driving Toyota's system, and later, the 
foundation of Lean Process Management or Lean 
Six Sigma, include:
  Defining customer values
  Identifying the value stream for customer needs and desires
  Identifying waste in the process
  Creation of a continuous process flow
  Continually working to reduce the 
number of steps and time it takes to reach customer 
satisfaction
 Lean management is highly concerned with removing waste from any process. Waste increases costs 
and time spent on a process, making it undesirable in any form. 
  Motorola™s Focus on Defects
 Though the basis for Six Sigma was laid in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it wasn't until the mid
-1980s that these concepts saw large
-scale success 
in the United States. Decades after Toyota developed 
its system, engineers at Motorola began to question how effective their quality management programs 
were. Those questions first arose after a Japanese company took over a Motorola television 
What is Jidoka?
 Jidoka is a principle that creates 
control of defects inside a business 
process. Instead of identifying defects 
at the end of the production line and 
attempting to trace errors back to a 

source, jidoka demands that 
a process stop as soon as errors are 
detected so improvements or 
troubleshooting can happen 
immediately. 
 For jidoka to work properly, machines 
are often equipped to recognize bad 
outputs from good outputs; the 

machines are also equipped with a 
notificatio
n of some type to spark 
human interaction in the process 
when things go awry.

 manufacturin
g plant. By applying Lean concepts, the new company began creating televisions that 
demonstrated 1/20
th the amount of defects as Motorola™s own television sets.
 At the time, departments across Motorola measured defects as a ratio of a thousand opportunitie
s. Bob 
Galvin, the CEO of Motorola, issued a challenge to his team. He wanted to see an improvement in 

quality and production
Šnot just any improvement; he wanted a ten
-fold improvement in half a decade. 
Engineer Bill Smith and a new addition to the Motorol
a team 
Œ Dr. Mikel Harry 
Œ began to work on the 
problem.
 The team realized that measuring errors against a thousand opportunities didn't provide the level of 
detail needed for true statistical process control. Instead, the engineers wanted to measure defec
ts 
against a million opportunities. We know that sigma levels were already defined and the idea of using 
sigma levels as a measure of quality began with Shewhart. It wasn't a long jump for the Motorola 

engineers to make from their desire for more accurate 
data to the basic concepts of Six Sigma as both a 
goal and a methodology.
 Throughout the next two decades, Motorola worked to perfect its Six Sigma methodology, seeing 
positive results along the way. In addition to statistical tools, the team created a ste
p-by
-step process by 
which any team
--in almost any industry
--could make gains and improvements. For the first time, this 
type of statistical process control was taken out of the manufacturing environment on a large scale 

company
-wide. Motorola applied the 
method to customer service, engineering, and technical support. It 
used the process to create a collaborative environment between stakeholders inside and outside of the 
organization. It was highly successful; according to Motorola, the company saved more t
han $16 billion 
as a result of continuous process improvement initiatives within 12 years.
5 Motorola did more than improve its own systems and products, though. Galvin directed his team to 

share Six Sigma with the world. Motorola and its team published art
icles and books on the Six Sigma 
method and implemented efforts to train others.
 In this way, they created a methodology based on 
statistics that could be taught and implemented within any organization or industry. 
 ABB, Allied Signal, and General Electric
 After leaving Motorola, Dr. Harry joined Asea Brown Boveri. At ABB, Harry worked with Richard 
Schroeder, who would also become a champion for Six Sigma. In fact, the two men later cofounded the 

Six Sigma Academy. At ABB, Harry came 
to realize 
a key idea i
n the evolution of Six Sigma: business, or 
profits, in some ways came before quality. Quality, in fact, was a driving factor of business. Customers 
didn™t make purchases if quality was poor. Because the individuals with the ability to decide in favor of 

Six Sigma initiatives were highly motivated by dollars, Harry incorporated financial tactics into the Six 
Sigma methodology. For the first time, the method was focused on the bottom
-line as a primary goal 
with other concerns and goals stemming from 
financial
ly-led goals.
 In 1993, both Schroeder and Harry changed jobs, joining the team at Allied Signal. Allied Signal™s CEO at 
the time was Larry Bossidy. He was interested in Six Sigma but realized that executives and other high
-level leaders experienced knowled
ge barriers while attempting to interact and collaborate with analysts, 
process engineers, and Six Sigma experts. Bossidy suggested that leadership at a company had to be

-versed in Six Sigma to pick the right projects for success and support those pro
jects on a company
-wide basis to ensure success.
 Harry, who is sometimes referred to as the father of Six Sigma, created a system for educating executive 
leaders. In conjunction with others at Allied Signal, he developed systems that allowed Six Sigma to b
e 
effectively deployed by leadership throughout an organization in its entirety.
 Around the same time, GE CEO Jack Welch entered into the Six Sigma arena. Prior to learning about Six 
Sigma, Welch had stated he was not a proponent of quality measures. He™d 
previously criticized quality 
programs as heavy
-handed approaches that did little to deliver results. Welch invited Larry Bossidy to 
speak at a GE corporate meeting in 1995. He also requested an analysis regarding the benefits of 

implementing Six Sigma at 
GE. At that 
time
, GE was performing at between three and four sigma
. The 
potential savings should the company rise to six sigma were enormous; 
estimates
 were $7 to $10 
billion.
6 Welch is known as a champion of Six Sigma not because he contributed in major 
ways to the 
development of statistical process controls or the Six Sigma toolsets, but because he demonstrated 

exactly how leaders should approach Six Sigma. He also made GE a historically successful Six Sigma 
organization by tying Six Sigma goals to emplo
yee reward structures. Employees were no longer only 
compensated based on financial performance factors
; they were also evaluated based on Six Sigma 
performance. Suddenly, employees at every level had a personal reason to become involved in 

continuous proc
ess improvement, and employees and managers were supplied with the Six Sigma 
training to succeed.
 Continued Growth of Six Sigma
 Following the success of corporations such as GE and Motorola, companies across the country rushed to 
implement Six Sigma. Unfor
tunately, in the rush to implement the process, many organizations executed 
improvements poorly or failed to gain an adequate understanding of statistical process control before 
moving forward with improvements. Although Six Sigma methods have been used by
 organizations to 
gain millions
Ševen billions
Šin savings and efficiencies, some companies walked away with a bad taste 
for the process. That bad taste has resulted in the following misconceptions and myths that are still 
prevalent today in many industries:
  Six Sigma is solely concerned with metrics and ignores common sense.
 The opposite is actually 
true: Six Sigma often starts with traditional common sense ideas, often arrived at through 

brainstorming, and validates those assumptions with data. The reason f
or this myth is twofold. 
First, managers and others who are used to making calls without being questioned are suddenly 
questioned in a Six Sigma environment. Not only are they questioned, but hard data sometimes 
proves them wrong. Second, in some cases dat
a is improperly used to support conclusions that 
are against common sense or tradition. When those conclusions turn out to be faulty, it™s easy 
to blame the process of Six Sigma there is a lack of adequate understanding of the statistical 
theories involved
.  Six Sigma is too expensive
. While enterprise
-wide adoption of Six Sigma can be costly at first, 
due in part to training needs, slowly integrating the concepts into a company often costs very

adopt Six Sigma with budgetary 
concerns
Šbut when implemented correctly, Six Sigma generally leads to savings that more than 
cover its initial investment.
  Six Sigma can fix anything.
 Opposite the nay
-sayers are Six Sigma cheerleaders who believe they 
can ap
ply the method like a salve to any problem. While Six Sigma can be applied to any 
problem of process, it™s not always relevant to problems of culture or people. If morale or other 
human resource problems are at the root of an issue, statistics can™t help. 
However, if morale is 
low because a process is difficult to work with or is performing poorly, Six Sigma can be used to 
improve the process, thereby improving morale.
  Applying Six Sigma Knowledge
 Six Sigma is applied via a controlled project selection and
 management process. Once areas of concern 
are identified, leaders usually turn to analysts, Six Sigma experts, and subject
-matter
-experts for cost
-benefit analyses. Six Sigma teams attempt to quantify how broken a process is (by calculating sigma 
level, c
osts of defects, downtime, and other metrics) and how much it might cost to address the 
problem. Problems are then prioritized according to severity as well as an organization™s ability to 
address the issue. Teams begin working through the priority list, r
eturning to the analysis from time to 
time to ensure the list has not changed. The majority of this book covers the methods by which teams 

identify and address problems using Six Sigma.
 The Levels of Six Sigma Certification
 Possessing a Six Sigma certifica
tion proves that an individual has demonstrated practical applications 

and knowledge of Six Sigma. Some organizations offer in
-house certification processes. Most people 
seek certification
 by
 enrolling in online or onsite Six Sigma training course. Most organizations that offer 
Six Sigma education also offer a path to certification. You can take courses for certification at various 

levels; Six Sigma levels are differentiated by belt level.
 Whi
te Belt
 A certified Six Sigma White belt is familiar with the basic 
tenets 
of the Six Sigma methodology, though 
they aren™t often regular members of process improvement teams. White belt training is a good 

introduction to Six Sigma for auxiliary staff memb
ers within an organization and can provide the 
information necessary for understanding why project teams 
do 
what they do. The training lets 
employees review project processes, understand information presented in milestone meetings, and 

better participate i
n project selection processes. White belt training can also be used across all levels of 
employees when organizations are attempting to implement a Six Sigma culture. It is worth noting that 
White Belt training usually only provides a very basic introducti
on and overview of Six Sigma, so much so 
that not all Six Sigma professionals recognize it as a true Six Sigma certification.
 Yellow Belt
 A yellow belt certification is a step above white belt: it is still considered a basic introduction to the 
concepts o
f Six Sigma, but a yellow belt learns basic information about the DMAIC method often used to 
improve processes. The following concepts are often included in Six Sigma yellow belt training:
  Six Sigma roles
 Page | 
21  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
  Team development and management
  Basic quality tools
 such as Pareto charts, run charts, scatter diagrams and histograms
  Common Six Sigma metrics
  Data collection
  Measurement system analysis
  Root cause analysis
  An introduction to hypothesis testing
 At the yellow belt level, training is often geared toward und
erstanding of the overall methodology and 
basic data collection. Yellow belts don™t need to know how to conduct hypothesis testing, but they must 
understand the language of hypothesis testing and the conclusions that are drawn from such tests. 
Yellow belts
 are often employees who need to know about the overall process and why it is being 
implemented.
 Green Belt
 Certified green belts work within Six Sigma teams, usually under the supervision of a black belt or 
master black belt. In some cases, green belts mi
ght lead or handle smaller projects on their own. Green 
belts are generally equipped with intermediate statistical analysis capabilities; they might address data 
and analysis concerns, help Black Belts apply Six Sigma tools to a project, or teach others wi
thin an 
organization about the overall Six Sigma methodology. 
 Green Belts can be middle managers, business analysts, project managers, and others who have a 
reason to be involved regularly with process improvement initiatives but who might not be a full
-time 
Six Sigma expert within an organization. Sometimes, Green Belts are considered the worker bees of the 
Six Sigma methodology because they undertake most of the statistical data collection and analysis under 

the supervision of certified Black Belts.
 The 
following concepts are often included in Green Belt training:
  All of the information listed for yellow belt certification
  Failure mode and effects analysis
  Project and team management
  Probability and the Central Limit Theorem
  Statistical distributions
  Descriptive statistics
  How to perform basic hypothesis testing
  Waste elimination and Kaizen
  Basic control charts
  Black Belt
 A certified Six Sigma Black Belt usually works as the project leader on process improvement projects. 
They might also work within m
anagement, analyst, or planning roles throughout a company. Common 
minimum requirements for black belt certification include everything listed for yellow and green belts in 
addition to:
  Advanced project and team management skills

  Knowledge of the expansive
 list of Six Sigma brainstorming and project tools
  Intermediate to advanced statistics
  An understanding of other process improvement and quality programs, including Lean and Total 
Quality Management
  An ability to design processes
  Advanced capabilities for 
diagraming processes, including flow charts and value stream maps
  Use of software to conduct analysis, such as Excel or Minitab
 Master Black Belt
 A Master Black Belt is the highest certification level achievable for Six Sigma. Within a business 
organizatio
n, Master Black Belts usually manage Black Belts and Green Belts, consult on especially 
difficult project concerns, offer advice and education about challenging statistical concepts, and train 
others in Six Sigma methodology. 
 Certification Exams
 Most cert
ification 
programs 
require individuals to pass an exam for certification; some require that 
green and black belt candidates also demonstrate their knowledge in the form 
of 
Six Sigma project 
experience. 
 If an exam is required for white or yellow belt certi
fication, it is usually fairly short and covers basic 

concepts about the methodology. Green belt exams are longer and might include questions about 

statistics and some basic calculations. Black belt exams often take up to four hours to complete; they 
test 
for understanding and application. Exams might include difficult statistical problems or questions 
about how a project leader might handle various situations. While exams differ by organization, this 
book is designed based on

 Chapter 3: Other Process Improvement and 
Quality Methods
  By studying the history of Six Sigma, you™ve already realized that the methodology is closely related to a 
number of other quality
-driven initiatives developed over the past century. This is true in part because 
all successful businesses ultimately seek to
 do the same thing: 
serve a customer a product or service 
they need while making as much profit as possible. 
 While Six Sigma encompasses all the tools
 you need to approach virtually any problem of process, 
familiarity with other types of process improveme
nt and quality methods is important. Some of these 
methods, such as Lean and JumpStart, add value within a Six Sigma approach. Others might be used by 
outside resources alongside a Six Sigma project. Even if you don™t use or work with some of these 
program
s, you will need to communicate with leadership and business partners who are more familiar 
with other methods. The ability to frame Six Sigma concepts in a more global quality management 
approach can help you win support for your own projects.

-in-hand with Six Sigma principles. While Lean originally developed as a 
concept for reducing waste in a manufacturing environment, the ideas of Lean Process 
Management can 

be applied to any process that involves the movement or creation of goods or services. This is true even 
if those services are virtual or digital, such as in a computerized workflow process.
 One of the ways that Lean is similar to Six Sigma 
is that it is concerned with continuous improvements; 
like Six Sigma, Lean provides waste
-removal tools so daily control and improvements can be made to 
processes. 
In fact, one
 of
 Lean™s continuous improvement tools is called Kaizen, a Japanese word that 
translates loosely to ﬁchange for the better.ﬂ 
The purpose of every change in a Kaizen environment is to 

eliminate waste and/or create more value for the customer on a continuous b
asis.
 Lean Process Management can be deployed within a project environment or in daily production. Like Six 

Sigma, Lean is more about an overall culture of quality than a single quality event. Many organizations 

use Lean principles
  to make improvements in processes. By simply instituting some of the
 Lean
 principles
, managers can drastically increase production and reduce costs for their departments. 
 Because Lean principles are so effective a
nd fit so well with Six Sigma principles, for the purpose of this 

book, we will often treat Lean as a part of the Six Sigma methodology.
  Total Quality Management
 Total Quality Management, or TQM, is a phrase well
-known by anyone who worked in business in 
the 
last quarter of the 20
th century. The TQM approach to quality is one of the first formal methods enacted 
in business environments in the United States. Originally developed in the 1950s, Total Quality

 Management didn™t become popular with companies acr
oss the country until the 80s. At one point, 
TQM was so popular with executives and other leaders that it actually became something of a joke 
among certain workforces who believed that much effort and expense was expended on quality without 
an equal result
ing benefit. In fact, if you remember from the last chapter, Jack Welch at GE felt this way.
 While Total Quality Management programs were often somewhat lackluster when it came to results, the 

method was an essential stepping point to current improvement a
nd quality methods such as Six Sigma. 
TQM was not without its results: as with any method, results depended highly on the way the program 
was implemented and the culture of the organization. For this reason, TQM and its variations are still in 

play in many
 industries today. Some requirements for a successful TQM program include:
  A strict quality commitment at all levels of the organization, especially among leaders
  Empowered employees who can make quality decisions while working within the process 
without c
onstantly seeking leadership approval for those decisions
  A reward and recognition structure to promote quality work so that employees have a reason to 
make quality
-making decisions
  Strategic planning that takes quality and quality improvement goals into a
ccount when making 
long
-term decisions
  Systems that let organizations make improvements and monitor quality
  Successful TQM initiatives require eight key elements: ethics, integrity, trust, training, teamwork, 
leadership, recognition, and communication. Yo
u can view these elements as if they were part of the 
components needed to build a high
-quality, lasting building. Ethics, integrity, and trust become the 
foundation for quality. Training, teamwork, and leadership are the bricks by which quality organizati
ons 
are built. Honest, open, and concise communication is the mortar that binds everything else together, 
and recognition is the roof that covers everything, providing employees with a reason to seek and 

maintain quality. 
 One of the biggest advantages of 
the TQM mentality is that it began to force organizations to see 
themselves as one entity rather than a number of loosely related entities or departments. Prior to the 
quality methods developed in the last half of the 20
th century, many organizations were 
run via heavily 
siloed departments. One department 
often 
did not understand what another was doing, which caused a 
great deal of rework and waste. Each department might seek higher quality levels or process 
improvements, but in the end, the organization wa
s only as strong as the weakest element. 
 TQM began to change departmental thinking on a massive scale: organizations began to take enterprise 

approaches to decision making, quality, and customer 
service
. Business leaders started to look at 
companies as a 
series of linked processes operating toward a single end goal. Within the bounds of 
TQM, the ideas for business process reengineering began to develop.
 Organizations using TQM often experienced benefits such as:
  Improved employee engagement and morale
  A re
duction in production or product costs
  Decreased cycle times
  More satisfied customers

 Business Process Reengineering
 Six Sigma, Lean and TQM are all concerned with making 
continuous
 changes on both a large and small 
scale that bring an organization ever cl
oser to a model of perfection. In the case of Lean, that model is a 
process that has zero waste; in Six Sigma, the model is statistically 6 sigma. In TQM, organizations often 
define their own version of perfection before working toward it. Business Process
 Reengineering, or 
BPR, is less concerned with incremental quality wins and more concerned with a radical change across 
an entire organization or process architecture.
 Business process reengineering, which is also called business process redesign, is most 
often concerned 
with the technical processes that occur throughout an organization. Those processes might include 
systems, software, data storage, cloud and web processes, and computer
-based workflows operated 
and maintained by human users. Because of the 
intense integration of automation and computer 
elements into processes with BPR, organizations 
that
 enter BPR endeavors have to rely heavily on both 
inside and outside technical resources. Inside resources provide programming, integration, and 
troublesh
ooting services as processes are developed or redesigned. Outside resources can be BPR 
consultants, contracted programmers and developers, or vendors bringing new software products to the 
table. 
 As you can probably imagine, BPR initiatives can be costly, 
which is why they are often deployed only 
when an organization expects exponential gain or has determined that current processes are obsolete 
or badly broken. 
 BPR projects tend to follow a common map, though there isn™t a defined set of principles as ther
e is with 
Six Sigma. Most projects go through planning, design, and implementation phases. During planning, 
teams use process mapping and process architecture principles to define enterprise
-wide processes in 
their current state. Teams look for opportuniti
es for improvement and brainstorm new architectures for 
processes throughout the organization. 
 During the design phase, BPR teams use validation techniques 
3 to ensure solutions they are p
lanning 
will work within the enterprise structure. They also begin to build tools and programs to integrate the 
changes; technical teams might use the Scrum methods described later in this chapter at this point in 
the process. 
 Finally, organizations imple
ment the changes they have made. Since changes are often programmatic in 
nature, implementation usually includes a rigorous change management and testing procedure. Testing 
in technical environments includes steps such as:
  Sandbox testing of basic function
ality
  Quality assurance testing by trained technical resources
  Beta testing during which experienced subject
 matter
 experts vet all aspects of a program in a 
limited live environment
  A rollout of the program to the enterprise, often conducted in a phased a
pproach during which 
technical resources are on call to immediately resolve troubleshooting issues
  A conversion to regular function where technical resources are available in a normal capacity to 
deal with occasional issues

 Rummler
-Brache
 As process improv
ement methods became increasingly popular in the 1980s and later, individuals often 
took portions of one method or another and integrated it into new improvement or quality programs. In 
this manner, companies outside of the manufacturing industry began imp
lementing bits and pieces of 
methods that incorporated Lean and Six Sigma elements. One such program is known as Rummler
-Brache.
 Rummler
-Brache was pioneered in the 80s by Geary Rummler and Alan Brache. They developed what 
remains a proprietary program use
d by their own consulting firm, but details of the method have been 
published and used by others. The method seeks to 
affect positive change in processes and 
organizations by using a set of practical tools to address business issues and process problems. 
 One of the foundational components of Rummler
-Brache is known as the Nine Boxes Model. The model 
is created by a matrix of three performance levels and three performance dimensions. Performance 
levels are the performer, the process, and the organization. D
imensions are management, design, and 
goal. When placed on a grid, the levels and dimensions form nine boxes, as seen below.
  Management
 Design
 Goals
 Performer
 Concerned with 
feedback, 

consequences, and 

rewards
 Concerned with the 
tools and training

well as job 
documentation
 Concerned with

and requirements at an 

individual level
 Process
 Concerned with who 
owns the process and 

how they might 
improve it

design of the process, 
work space, or syste
m Concerned with the 
requirements of the 

business and the 
customer
 Organization
 Concerned with overall 
leadership culture and 
the requirements of 
performance 
evaluation
 Concerned with overall 
org charts and process 
architecture
 Concerned with 
operating pl
ans and 
top
-level metrics
   Rummler
-Brache approaches improvement in six phases:
  Improvement planning.
 During the first phase, leadership and subject
-matter
-experts commit 
to making improvements and begin to identify opportunities for change.
  Definition
. During the second phase, project goals and scopes are defined and teams are formed 
to create improvements.
  Analysis and Design
. Teams use analysis to understand the current problem and to define and 

validate workable solutions.

  Implementation
. Teams implement process changes. Depending on the type of change, this 
might include programming changes, retraining staff, changes in machinery or equipment, or 
policy changes.  
  Management of process
. Teams monitor the process during and immediately fo
llowing the 
change to ensure improvements function as planned.
  Processes are turned over to daily teams
. Management of the process is turned over to daily 
teams, often with some type of control in place to ensure continued success.
 Scrum
 Scrum is a project
 development method specific to Agile programming endeavors in technical 
departments. Scrum is used when teams want to create new technical products or integrate new 
developments on existing products within a short time frame. Commonly, Scrum projects last
 between 
two and four weeks, which is traditionally a very tight timeline for programming projects. Scrum was 
developed as programming and development teams needed a way to meet continuous technical design 
and improvement needs from other departments witho
ut substantially increasing programming
, 
testing 
employee hours
, or hiring more technical staff. Scrum can also be used to drive faster times to 
production or market for software and application products.
 Scrum is a related concept to other process improve
ment initiatives discussed in the book because many 

projects today call for some type of technical resource or change. While project teams are working to 
validate and measure, technical departments often simultaneously deploy Scrum concepts to meet 
develop
ment needs for the improvement project by deadline.
 Scrum projects feature three main phases:
  The pregame
. Development teams analyze available data and business requirements. They use 
this information 
to 
come up with the concept for the new product or upgr
ade. Often, this 
involves translating business and process concepts into computer and technical concepts.
  The game
. Teams begin to develop the product via programming sprints. Sprints are smaller 
phases of development that are completed in sequence, usuall
y with a review and validation of 
the work before moving on
 to the next sprint. By validating work during development, teams 
are able to create working products faster.
  The postgame
. Even though validation occurs during development, teams still have to fol
low 
quality assurance, testing, and change management procedures. Quality preparation for product 

release is handled in the final phase.
 The Customer Experience Management Method (CEM)
 Like Rummler
-Brache, the Customer Experience Management Method, or CEM 
Method, was created by 
process improvement consultants to address needs in organizations outside of manufacturing. CEM 
combines some process improvement tools with customer relations management. It was developed in 

the 1990s by the Virgin Group and became 
popular throughout the 90s and early part of the 21
st century.
 The CEM Method takes an outside
-in approach to process improvement, focusing on what the customer 
wants or needs and how each process in an organization serves that need. The primary purpose of
 CEM 
is to align processes throughout an organization with customer satisfaction goals. As such, even 
processes without a direct relation to customers are defined in terms of customers.

 For example, shipping processes are obviously directly related to end
 customers, so it™s easy to define 
how those processes can best serve customers. Shipments should arrive on time, be accurate to orders, 
and shipping costs should be affordable.  
 In-house human resource processes are harder to link to customer
-facing goal
s. However, the morale 
and functionality of employees 
is directly related to how those employees can serve customers. You can 
make a customer
-facing statement about almost any process in an organization in this manner
. If organizations cannot link a proces
s to the customer, then they must ask whether the process is 
necessary or broken.
 Like Six Sigma, CEM relies heavily on data. Organizations can™t make determinations about customer 
goals and the success of processes without collecting and analyzing custome
r feedback. The advantage 
of CEM is that organizations are able to deploy customer
-facing tactics across the enterprise, which 
often results in enormous gains in customer satisfaction, loyalty, and spending. A disadvantage of this 
method is that traditiona
lly inward
-facing departments, such as human resources, legal, and accounting, 
often have a difficult time implementing customer
-focused cultural change.
 JumpStart
 JumpStart differs from the other programs and methods described in this chapter in that it i
s a fast
-paced method for identifying problems and solutions in a single session. JumpStart can be used within 
almost all of the other methods described in this book as a way to spark discussion regarding processes 
or 
to 
identify possible solutions. It can
 also be used as a management tool for helping teams come to 
tenable solutions outside of project environments or in the absence of project resources. 
 Because JumpStart doesn™t take the time for rigorous verification or statistical analysis on its own, te
ams 
should not use this method to enact sweeping changes or attempt to improve processes that could 
seriously impact customer experience or the bottom line. One disadvantage of using JumpStart alone is 

that changes are sometimes made on a wait
-and
-see ment
ality, which is safe for many inner
-team 
changes but often dangerous for department or enterprise
-wide processes
, or for making changes to 
processes that are closely tied to regulatory or compliance rules.
 JumpStart usually begins when leaders at some leve
l identify an area of concern or opportunity. The 
manager, supervisor, or other delegate identifies a team of employees who they believe would offer 
appropriate insight on the issue at hand. In most cases, JumpStart doesn™t work to define the problem: 
the 
group is close enough to the issue that they already know what is wrong. Instead, the group spends 
several hours brainstorming root causes for the problem and coming up with possible solutions. 
 Six Sigma and other process improvement tools can be deployed
 during JumpStart sessions. Fishbone 
diagrams and solutions selections matrixes, both covered in later chapters, can be used to validate 

assumptions using only the knowledge of the people in the room and some quick research. 
 The benefit of JumpStart is th
at it lets teams create and implement small
-scale solutions quickly, often 
providing problem resolution the same day. It also lets teams identify issues that need to be addressed 

in a more comprehensive project environment.

 When to Use Six Sigma
 Some orga
nizations make use of various project improvement methods. As a Six Sigma expert, you 
might have to champion your own method on occasion. Here are some reasons to choose Six Sigma over 
other methods described in this chapter.
 When facing the unknown
 Six 
Sigma is designed so you can begin a project even when you don™t know the cause of the problem. In 
some cases, teams aren™t even sure what the exact problem is 
Œ they only know some metric is not 
performing as desired. For example, an organization might ex
perience a drop in profits that doesn™t 
correct itself in several consecutive quarters. Six Sigma methods can begin to seek the causes of the 
problem, prioritize them, and work toward solutions.
 When problems are widespread and not defined
 Even when a prob
lem is understood, if it is wide in scope and not well defined, improvement projects 
that are not tightly managed can escalate in scope to a point that they become unmanageable. In this 
situation, teams attempt to solve increasingly bigger issues
. As a res
ult,
 no problem is ever completely 
solved. Six Sigma includes controls for avoiding such scope creep so teams can make incremental 
improvements that steadily improve a process over time. We™ll talk about scope creep more in later 
chapters.
  When solving co
mplex problems
 If processes are complex and feature many variables, it is difficult to determine how to approach a 

solution, much less define and measure success. Knowledge of statistical analysis and process control 

lets teams approach problems that invol
ve enormous amounts of data and many variables. Through 
analysis and graphical representation, complex ideas can be distilled to specific hypotheses, premises, 
and conclusions. 
 When costs are closely tied to processes
 Because Six Sigma™s statistical proce
ss control component lets teams make more accurate assumptions 
than almost any other method, it is very appropriate for situations that are closely tied to revenue or 
cost. When a single tiny change can result in millions of dollars in gains or losses, tea
ms must validate 
assumptions with an extremely small margin of error. Guesswork, basic research, and even years of 
experience cannot do that as accurately as properly implemented Six Sigma methods.

 Chapter 4: Lean Concepts
  We™ve discussed Lean concepts 
in the previous three chapters because most Six Sigma approaches 
today incorporate Lean concepts into problem solving and the control of a process. In fact, organizations 
often use the term Lean Six Sigma when describing a process improvement approach that
 incorporates 
tenants from both Six Sigma and Lea
n methodologies. This is a popular approach because the greatest 
results usually come when you improve a process so that both defects and waste are eliminated. That 

statement rings true whether you™re measur
ing from a business
-driven bottom
-line or a customer
-satisfaction approach.
 A Six Sigma defect is a failure to meet a requirement in a process. We™ll talk more about requirements in 
Chapter 8 when we define quality. For now, know that 
defects
 cost money be
cause businesses have to 
replace parts, equipment, or products that are not perfect. Organizations also experience financial loss 
associated with defects when quality reputation is so low that customers choose not to return or 
purchase from the company. Fr
om a customer satisfaction standpoint, defects can increase the time it 
takes for a customer to get what they want or can cause the customer to be unhappy with the end 
product or service.
 Waste
 costs money because it is unnecessary time, labor, or material
 in the process. Generally, waste is 
something that is used in the process that isn™t required for a satisfactory outcome. In some cases, 

waste creates a customer satisfaction issue because it holds up the process or introduces undesirable 

elements or defe
cts in the end product. 
 In this chapter, we™ll look at some specific types of waste and how to avoid them as well as touch on 
some Lean concepts for creating the most efficient processes. 
 The Seven Muda
 Muda
 is a Japanese word that translates to waste. I
t describes a concept of being useless, unnecessary, 
or idle. The concept that muda must be eliminated in a process is a driving concept of the Toyota 

Production System and Lean manufacturing. Muda is a non
-value
-added task (NVA) within a process. 
Some typ
es of muda are easier to identify than others, which is why Lean Six Sigma deploys tools such as 
value stream mapping. By understanding a process at all levels, teams are more likely to identify various 

forms of muda. According to Taiicho Ohno, chief engin
eer for Toyota, there are seven muda
, or 
resources that are commonly misused and mismanaged: overproduction, correction, inventory, motion, 
conveyance, over processing, and waiting. 
 Overproduction
 Overproduction is one of the easiest forms of muda to spot
, as it tends to result in what we commonly 
think of as waste. Overproduction means a product, part, or service was produced too fast, at the wrong 
time, or in too much quantity for the process. To understand the idea of overproduction, consider a 

basic fa
st food restaurant that offers hamburgers and French fries for lunch. The restaurant does not 
serve breakfast, and it opens its doors at 11:00 a.m. for the lunch crowd.
 If the cooks light up the grill at 11:00 a.m., then they might start the day behind
, as it is possible that 
several orders will be placed immediately. However, if the cooks start making hamburger patties at 
Page | 
31  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 10:30 a.m., they might have patties that sit for some time before being consumed, which leads to 
customer dissatisfaction or waste if th
e patties are thrown out. Making 10 patties every 10 minutes 
starting at 10:30 a.m. is overproduction
Šthe patties are being made too soon.
 What if the restaurant owners have done some research and they know the average number of orders 

between 11:00 and 11
:15 a.m. on a Tuesday is 10 hamburgers? They might instruct the cooks to begin 
making patties at 10:50 a.m. and to make 5 patties every 10 minutes. The goal is to align patty
-making 
with customer orders so that wait times are reduced but customers are stil
l able to enjoy fresh patties.
 By noon, the owners know orders tend to come in quickly, so they ask the cooks to make 15 patties 
every 10 minutes. By 2:00 p.m., however, the order traffic usually drops to 10 hamburgers an hour. If 
the cooks are still makin
g 15 every 10 minutes, then the process suffers from overproduction.
 At some point, the traffic in the restaurant may call for made
-to-order grilling
Ša process where the 
cook only makes hamburger patties as they are ordered to avoid wasting any materials. 
By 

understanding the traffic trends in their restaurant, the owners are able to estimate needs and create 

processes that reduce the amount of waste made in the kitchen while still meeting the quality demands 
of customers.
 Overproduction is most often assoc
iated with tangible outcomes from a process, though these 
outcomes don™t have to be final, or ﬁend productsﬂ of said processes. Consider a business that prints 
business cards, stationary, invitations, and other documents. Perhaps this business offers a pri
nting and 
mailing service; to complete this service, the company uses a machine
-driven process that prints, folds, 
and stuffs mailings. The printer is capable of delivering 1,000 pages an hour, but the folding machine is 
only able to fold 800 pages an hour
.  Even if a customer wants 1,000 pages printed and mailed, the printer is overproducing if the first 

machine is set to operate at maximum speed. The process will take longer than one hour because it is 
contingent upon the slowest machine. Since the overpr
oduction doesn™t result in tangible waste 
Œ the 
printed pages will eventually be folded and mailed 
Œ the company™s process owners have to consider 
other factors in order to decide if the temporary overproduction is detrimental to the process. Does the 
stac
king of extra paper before the folding process create an extra risk for error? Does operating the 
printing machine at maximum capacity without necessity put unnecessary strain or wear and tear on it? 

If the answer is yes to either question, then there exis
ts waste that should be eliminated from the 
process. 
 Overproduction can also exist with regard to reporting, digital assets, and preparation for processes. 
Almost anyone working in a business environment is familiar with reporting requirements
Šjust as 
almost anyone who has created reports knows the unfortunate truth that the information often goes 
unread. Creating reports no one reads
Šor creating highly detailed reports when an overview would 
suffice
Šis overproduction. 
 Preparing equipment that isn™t used 
in a process is also overproduction. Surgery centers often prepare 
machines, equipment trays, and operating rooms before shifts begin. The goal is to create efficient 
processes for any patient operation; staff must also be able to access equipment quickly 
if issues arise 
during procedures. Preparing 20 trays of equipment on a day when only 10 surgeries are scheduled 
might be considered overproduction if there is no use for the extra trays.
 Page |

8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 In some situations, such as the medical example above, processes mig
ht call for slight overproduction. If 
10 surgeries are scheduled, staff might prepare 13 or 14 equipment trays. This way, if an emergency 
surgery arrives, or if an issue comes up with an existing tray, stand
-by equipment is available.  By 
understanding nua
nces within processes and requirements, Six Sigma teams can better identify muda of 
overproduction versus overproduction
 that might be required by regulation or problem
-solving policies.
 The key to eliminating overproduction is planning. In the examples above, you™ll note that each solution 

came when the process operator understood the needs inherent within the process. When the owners 
knew how many orders were likely, they were able to pl
an to reduce waste. When the printer knows the 
capability of each machine in the process, he or she can plan for the most efficient printing run.  
 Correction
 Also known as muda of rework, this form of waste often plagues organizations that are keen on 

tra
ditional quality programs. In a desire to eliminate defects from the end product, organizations 
institute in
-process quality checks that route work with defects back for correction. While rework might 
be necessary in some cases, especially if materials are
 particularly valuable and work is worth saving 
rather than scrapping, it is still waste in the process that should be identified and analyzed. 
 When rework occurs, it increases overall process time and uses additional labor and materials to create 
a small
er amount of products or outputs. Let™s look at an example that might be found in the call center 
for a large automobile insurance company. Some of the calls coming into the center are from individuals 
who have sustained damage to vehicles in an accident. 
Consider the following process for handling such 
calls:
  The caller reports damage to the car.
  The representative records information in a computer form.
  The representative makes a decision based on the information provided by the caller:
  o The claim is rout
ed for immediate handling if it is deemed an emergency
 o The claim is routed to team A if it is a single
-car or act
-of
-God incident
 o The claim is routed to team B if it is a multi
-car accident
 Now, imagine a claim that arrives in the work queue for an employe
e working on team B. The 
information entered into the computer is incomplete, so the employee cannot determine for sure if the 

claim is related to a multi
-car accident. The employee might send the claim back to the original queue, 
which means a call
-center
 employee would have to call the insured back to gather additional 
information. The claim would then be routed again, according to the new information, and would wait 
in a work queue again.
 One of the biggest problems with muda of correction is that a case
 can often be made that the 
processing is necessary. Perhaps team B is not equipped to deal with single
-car incidents, so the work 
has to be rerouted if the claim is to be completed. But why not equip down
-line team members to 
handle any claim, or create a
 process for rerouting claims to the correct team without sending the work 
back to the original queue?
 Correction, or rework, can occur in any type of process. Manufacturing processes cull out defective parts 
and products; sometimes materials are reworked 
for a better outcome and sometimes they are 

scrapped
Šalso a form of waste. Call centers and digital work queues are famous for rework, as it™s easy 
Page | 
33  © 201

 to send work back and forth in a digital format. In some cases, rework occurs not because of correction, 
but
 simply because departmental or worker responsibilities overlap. 
 To eliminate rework or correction, organizations must use a twofold approach. First, the root cause of 

the rework
Šthat which is causing the errors
Šmust be addressed. Is fu
rther employee training 
required? Could a process be changed to make it more mistake proof? In some cases, the principles 
discussed in later units on process control, including a strategy called a poka yoke, can be deployed to 
make it more difficult to cre
ate defects than to not create defects during a process. When defects are 
avoided, rework is also avoided.
 In addition to addressing the root cause of errors, organizations should create quality steps that reduce 
rework waste. In the example about the insu
rance company call center, we noted that it would be more 
efficient for the down
-line worker to reroute the claim to the correct team than to return it to the 
original team. This method sometimes causes a problem of culture, though; there is a feeling amon
g 
leaders and staff that the first team or first team member should be held accountable for the error. One 

way of seeking accountability is to have that person correct his or her mistake. While reworking errors 
can be a good training method when time and r
esources allow, it isn™t always feasible and doesn™t make 
for an efficient daily process. Instead, employees might be more efficiently held accountable through 
goal
-setting and metrics for the greater good of the organization as a whole.
 Inventory
 Muda of 
inventory is similar to muda of overproduction; in fact, overproduction can cause a waste of 
inventory. Muda of inventory occurs when materials or inputs stack up before a step in the process; this 
phenomenon 
is also called a bottleneck. Remember the print
ing example for overproduction? If the first 
machine is set to the highest production level, it will generate 1,000 pages an hour. The folding machine 
can only handle 800 pages an hour, so you would have an inventory of 200 pages created every hour. If 
bot
h machines ran at highest production for four hours, the process would have developed an inventory 
of 800 pages. Until and unless the folding process becomes faster, then those extra pages are wasted 
inventory and will continue to pile up.
 Inventory waste 
can occur when items are purchased or created before they are needed in a 
manufacturing or service process. Inventory can also occur in work queues, digital data queues, or even 

email inboxes. If you receive 300 emails a day and you are only handling 30 of
 them on a regular basis, 
you have a process problem with your communications.
 While inventory waste can occur in any process, it is especially common in processes that operate in 

batches. Traditional lean wisdom says to avoid batch p
rocess 
Œ processes that involve creating a certain 
number of products or outputs before pushing them down the line. Reducing batch size lowers lead 
times
Šthe time it takes to deliver the end product. It also reduces the amount of inventory that occurs 
befo
re each step of the process. 
 While Lean mindsets usually push a batching
-is-bad mentality, you can™t always avoid it
Šand reduced 
lead times on individual outputs aren™t always a primary goal of a process. Consider a baker who is 
preparing an order of one 
dozen cupcakes. He could prepare the order as a batch, or he could prepare 
each cupcake separately. Obviously, mixing the ingredients and baking the cupcakes as a batch makes 
more sense. Decorating them as a batch also works well
Šthe baker might frost all 
of the cupcakes, add 
piping to all the cupcakes, and then top all the cupcakes with a candy. Batching works for the baker

 because the first cupcake is not going to leave the bakery before the 12
th is finished
Šthey all move 
together because they are conside
red a unit. 
 You can also reduce waste of inventory by understanding a process and basing inventory decisions on 
historic metrics. A shipping center that processes between 50,000 and 100,000 boxes a week wouldn™t 

place an order for 300,000 boxes if they on
ly wanted to have a week™s supply on hand. A baker doesn™t 
whip cream for seven pies if he or she only intends to make two. 
 Motion
 Muda of motion has to do with how employees themselves move during a process. This type of waste is 
often relevant to 
people
-powered processes in manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, delivery, or 
industrial fields, but waste of motion can even crop up in processes that are computerized.
 For example, if a data
-entry employee has to click back and forth between screens whe
n entering 
information, this could be muda of motion. If the system is designed so that a number is to be entered in 
one window and a second number entered in a different window, the click between windows is wasting 

motion. Moving to another window involve
s a mouse or keyboard action that could be eliminated if the 
data were entered on the same window. It seems like an inconsequential detail, but imagine what 
happens when the data employee completes this process hundreds or thousands of times a day. The 
was
te can absolutely add up:
  If each data
-entry employee completes 600 entries an hour on average, and there are 
10 employees on a team, the team is completing 48,000 entries each day.
  If it takes only half a second more to toggle between the two windows, the
 team is still 
spending a collective 400 minutes a day 
Œ just over 6.5 hours 
Œ toggling.
  If the average hourly wage for a data worker is $10, the team is spending an extra $325 

each week 
Œ almost $17,000 each year 
Œ to cover the act of toggling between win
dows.
 Given those numbers, a programing change that includes both data elements on the same window 

could save the company $17,000 in a single year. This same concept can be applied to any form of muda 
when you can apply a time and dollar figure to the wast
e. Other examples of muda of motion include a task that requires an individual to physically move back 
and forth between work, extra motion that stems from a poor layout of work, or movement that occurs 

when an employee leaves an area and has to return one
 or more times because he or she forgot 
something. Public libraries have long employed a simple tool to avoid muda of motion in the reshelving 
process: books are first ordered on a cart. The cart allows an employee to carry many books without 
moving back a
nd forth, and placing the books in order on the cart lets the individual move through the 
stacks once. If books are placed at random on the cart, the subsequent movement between shelves 
wastes motion and time.
 Streamlining company
 processes eliminates muda of motion, and data must be collected and analyzed 
to identify unnecessary movement. A common tool used in manufacturing and similar environments to 
track movement is known as a spaghetti diagram. Begin with a basic, bird™s eye d
rawing of the 
workspace. Include furniture, computer stations, machinery, doors, and walls. Observe an actual 
process, tracking any and all movements with a line on the diagram.
 Page |

 When drawn correctly, the diagram looks like a string of spaghetti fell onto y
our page. Once the process 
is complete, you can look at the diagram to see where the movements cross paths multiple times or go 
out of the way unnecessarily. This helps you find opportunities for streamlining the movement in a 
process
Šsometimes, it™s as si
mple as moving furniture or resources around to reduce unnecessary 
movement. It™s worth noting that a spaghetti diagram only reveals a snapshot of movement in time; 
sometimes, it is worthwhile to complete more than one such diagram at different times of da
y or with 
different employees to reveal an overall picture of a process and possible muda.
 Conveyance
 Muda of conveyance is similar to muda of movement except conveyance involves the movement of 
outputs, products, or resources. It is sometimes also referre
d to as muda of transportation. For example, 
in a doll
-making facility, if the glue that binds doll eyes to doll faces is kept in an inventory room and 
carried, as needed, to the process, there might be muda of conveyance. 
 If an expense report is printed 
and then carried to a manager for approval who then routes it in an 

inner
-office envelope to a director, who then carries it to the accounting department, the muda of 
conveyance is occurring. This is especially true because appropriate technology used corr
ectly and 
efficiently lets organizations handle expensive reporting via computer with little conveyance at all.
 If a plate is prepared by a chef and placed on a counter where a kitchen assistant moves the plate to a 
different table where wait staff know to
 pick it up, conveyance is occurring. The wait staff then carries 
the plate to the customer. 
 Conveyance can relate to physical movement of items or digital movement of data or workflow. Email 
strings, which are present in many work environments, often pre
sent muda of digital conveyance. A CEO 
might email a director with a request for data. The director emails a manager, who emails a supervisor, 
who emails a subject
-matter
-expert. The SME delivers the information to her supervisor, and the emails 
work their
 way back up the chain. The same request and information was conveyed multiple times when 
it only may have needed to be conveyed once. This allows for many opportunities for error.
 Some might point to chain
-of
-command concerns, but for the purpose of this 
example, if the data 
request is a repeated process, then it makes sense for the chain of command to inform the CEO where 

this information comes from. To go even further, a truly Lean process would require all waste be 
removed from this process. If the data
 requirement comes on a weekly basis, then Lean ideals require 
that the SME automatically generate the data and send it to the CEO weekly. 
 Physical conveyance is often easier to locate and address than digital conveyance. A spaghett
i diagram, 
process map, or value stream map can help you identify areas where muda of conveyance might exist. 
Spaghetti diagrams work well in physical conveyance situations, and process maps help you identify 

conveyance in digital settings. 
 Once you identify muda of conveyance, you can eliminate it by making changes in the process, layout, or 
inventory requirements for the work. If conveyance waste isn™t due to poor 
process design or work
-area 
layout, it might be related to another form of muda. Conveyance is often seen in processes that involve 

a lot of correction, because work is transferred back and forth between staff or areas. By addressing the 
muda of correction
, you often also address the muda of conveyance.

 Over
-processing
 Over
-processing occurs when an employee or process inputs more resources into a 
product
 or service 
than is valued by the customer. This could occur because of ignorance, a desire for 
perfection, or even 
excitement. Sometimes 
over
-processing occurs because an employee hasn™t had training on the most 
efficient way to handle a task. Other times, it occurs because an employee or process is more thorough 
than is worthwhile. A goal of any 
process should be to do just enough useful and necessary work to 
ensure that customer or end
-user expectations are met.
 One example of over
-processing often occurs in healthcare administrative offices during the insurance 
verification process. Insurance ve
rification occurs when a healthcare provider™s office attempts to verify 
that a person is covered by insurance for the services that are about to be rendered. Depending on the 
type of insurance coverage and the office™s policies, a staff member either chec
ks benefits via a 
computer program or calls the insurance company. 
 In most cases, the goal of insurance verification is simply to ensure that the insured is covered by the 
plan for the date the services are to be rendered. Sometimes, however, an office wo
rker delves deeper 
into the verification, spending up to an hour on the phone with an insurance company to receive 
detailed benefits or calling back to check with another representative to ensure the original information 
provided was correct. While specifi
c cases exist that require in
-depth insurance verification, basic 
doctor™s visits don™t require this level of work. A staff member who is 
taking up to
 an hour to verify 
insurance coverage is overproducing, and it™s probably causing productivity problems fo
r the office as a 
whole.
 In consumer
-centric processes, over
-processing occurs when you put more into a product than the value 
afforded by the customer. While product excellence is important, at some point the work you put into a 

product exceeds that which
 is deemed necessary or useful by the customer, and this is often tied to 
price point. A customer expects more out of a premium, more expensive model, for example.
 An example of over
-processing might be painting the bottom of an inside cabinet shelf when n
o one will 
ever see it. In a restaurant, ironing table linens to an exacting standard could be considered over
-
processing, especially if you remove the linens between meals for washing. In most restaurants, much of 
the table linen drapes over the table; ow
ners might want linens that aren™t full of wrinkles, but they 
don™t need crisp and perfect se
ams. In the technical world, building an app with 100 features when 99 
percent of people only want to use 10 main functions can be considered both over
-processing 
and over
-producing.
 A value stream map, covered in Chapter 35, is a good tool for identifying any points of over
-processing. 
Any part of the process that doesn™t provide value could be considered over
-processing; when the 
process features a series of linked events and none provide value, it™s even more likely that over
-processing is occurring. 
 In a true Lean process, every step of a process provides value, but it can be tricky to determine when 

value is not occurring. Qual
ity is important to both the success of the process and the end customer, for 
example, but the customer doesn™t care, or usually even realize, that your process is imbued with quality 
checks throughout. They care instead that a process takes 10 minutes lon
ger because of those quality 
checks
Šteams have to dig deep into processes, metrics, and customer voice to determine if those 10 
extra minutes are providing enough added value to cover the annoyance or loss of customer because of

 the added time. This knowle
dge is all ascertained through data collection and statistical analysis 
discussed in detail throughout this book.
 Waiting
 Muda of waiting refers to any idle time in a process, whether that idle time is for machinery or people. 

In other words, an employee o
r machine is working below capacity or is not working at all due to waiting 
on inputs from another part of the process. Waiting occurs when steps in the process are not properly 

coordinated, when processes are unreliable, when work is batched too large, du
ring rework, and during 
long changeovers between staff or machines.
 In a retail or fast food environment, when one cashier™s shift is over, another cashier takes over at the 
station. To maintain financial integrity, almost all companies switch out cash reg
ister drawers during the 
change between cashiers; if there is a mistake with the drawer, the company knows who was running 
the register at that point in time, making it easier to find trends or issues. However, when the drawer is 
being changed out, the reg
ister usually can™t be used. The cashier is simply waiting, sometimes along 
with the customer.
 To reduce the muda of waiting in this cash register example, most organizations use a process that 

includes a series of register drawers that are prepped at the 
beginning of the day or shift. The drawers 

are designed to be interchangeable in the registers, so the old drawer can be pulled and the new drawer 
put in in less than 30 seconds, solving the waste of waiting.
 Waste of waiting is common in construction envi
ronments. Construction of roads, bridges, buildings and 
other structures requires close attention to order and detail: you can™t build the roadway of a bridge 
until the pillars are in place and steady. This concept is seen even on a small scale in construc
tion, 
causing paid employees to often stand around waiting for others to complete a piece of the job before 

they can finish the assigned task.
 Because construction is a field of specialists and certifications, one employee often cannot do the work 
another 
can. In other words, employee tasks are not interchangeable. This causes additional muda of 
waiting; one group of construction workers might have to wait on the forklift operator to come and 
move some items. Meanwhile, the forklift operator is finishing up
 with a task on the other side of the 
construction lot. This isn™t a problem limited to construction: some offices have policies requiring an 
official IT staff member 
to 
handle any computer issue. Whether it™s a software glitch, a troubleshooting 
error, or
 simply the need to switch out an underperforming mouse, regular office staff must send a 
support ticket or make a phone call and wait for IT staff to solve the problem.
 You can eliminate waste of waiting within many processes by balanc
ing machinery, people, and 
production. The process will only perform as fast as the slowest link; beefing up the production of a 
single element does nothing for the whole, so teams must work to balance and improve the entire 
process. 
 Sometimes, scheduling
 is a key component in eliminating waiting. In the construction example, 
advanced planning and scheduling tactics could reduce the chance that one team would be waiting for a 
forklift operator while he or she is busy elsewhere.  Understanding organizationa
l, team, project, and 
process needs also helps leadership provide the right amount of resources to reduce waiting. The 

construction site might benefit from two forklift operators, for example. In the IT example, a company

 can reduce wait times by maximizin
g IT staffing at high
-volume times or implementing processes within 
the IT department to create more efficient responses to help tickets. An auxiliary IT staff member can be 
hired to handle less technical issues such as switching out an under
-performing mo
use.
 Other Forms of Waste
 While Toyota originally defined seven common muda, even Taiichi Ohno agreed that other types of 
waste exist. In some cases, what seems like other types of waste are just more defined or specific types 
of the seven muda discussed a
bove. Some forms of waste don™t seem to fit neatly into one of the seven 
muda categories. 
 Talent
 Talent can be wasted when a process doesn™t make the most use of the labor or staff available. If a 
process calls for data to be entered, and the staff member
 slowest on 10
-key is assigned to the task, 
resources are being wasted. Hiring the wrong person, putting staff in the wrong position, or ignoring a 
staff member™s growth potential could all be instances of muda of talent. Wasted talent is more a 
concern fo
r leadership and human resources than for process improvement specialists, though Six Sigma 
experts should be aware that the way personnel resources are handled can drastically impact the 
efficiency of a process. 
 Ideas
 Muda of ideas occurs when the though
ts and ideas of people are discounted, not sought out, or 
misappropriated in a way that doesn™t make sense. Leadership and project teams can often overlook 
subject
 matter
 experts 
who 
have detailed insight into a process and, as such, could offer first
-hand
 knowledge and ideas. The result could be the design of a process that works great in theory but falls flat 
on a granular level once it™s instituted. 
 One reason waste of ideas is such a concern for organizations is that people themselves rarely come 
forwa
rd with thoughts. Staff members might think they don™t have anything real to contribute, might 
feel like their ideas won™t be heard, or could be anxious about looking silly or ignorant. 
 Six Sigma Green or Black Belts in charge of projects can facilitate l
ess muda of ideas by encouraging 
subject
 matter
 experts to contribute and encouraging leaders to seek all ideas before moving forward 
with change. Brainstorming tools, which are covered in later chapters, are valuable for this purpose 
because they are desi
gned to create a safe haven for all ideas. By fostering all ideas in a safe 
environment, teams can foster valuable ideas and avoid waste of ideas.
 Capital/Cash
 Saving for a rainy day is smart, but banking cash when there are profits to gain isn™t always th
e right 
decision. Muda of capital or cash occurs when leadership decides not to invest in upgrades or 
improvements that would create additional cash flow. This type of waste is very similar to waiting, 
except the cash itself is waiting, often for a time wh
en leadership feels safe enough to spend it. 
 Six Sigma helps reduce muda of cash because statistical analysis helps point leaders to decisions that 
involve the least risk or most gain. No business decision is 100 percent guaranteed, but Six Sigma helps 
leaders hedge bets by using statistical data in the decision
-making process so they don™t sit on cash or 
capital that could be used to drive gains in efficiency, production, and profit.

 Two Types of Muda
 All muda is waste that fails to add value to a produc
t or process as defined by the customer or end
-user. 
All muda can also be divided into two overall types, which can help organizations prioritize waste for 
project and improvement purposes. Muda can be referred to as type I or type II.
 Type I Muda
 Type I m
uda are non
-value
-added tasks that might actually be essential or required by circumstances. 
Inspection of products during a process might be required if the process is known to produce defects. 
Organizations don™t want defects to reach customers, so they 
put quality controls in place. The act of 
the inspection, and the time and expense it adds to a process
 -- are all muda. However, an organization 
can™t remove that waste until it addresses the cause of the defects within the process.
 Sometimes, auxiliary p
rocesses within an organization are Type I muda. For example, the external end 
customer doesn™t receive direct value from human resource processes within an organization. At the 
same time, if employees don™t receive pay checks or support regarding benefits
, they aren™t likely to 
continue performing work. Those processes are then essential to the organization. Instead of removing 
the muda completely, teams might look for ways to make essential muda as efficient and 
cost
-effective 
as possible.
 Type II Muda
 Type II muda are non
-value
-added tasks that are not essential and can be immediately removed from a 
process. For example, if a product is carried to and from several work stations while it is being 
completed, it™s likely type II muda of conveyance exists. 
By rearranging the workflow, teams might be 
able to reduce the muda by a substantial amount without making any actual changes to how the 
product is put together.
   5S
 5S is a Japanese Lean approach to organizing a workspace, so that by making a process mor
e effective 
and efficient, it will become easier to identify and expunge muda. 5S relies on visual cues and a clean 
work area to enhance efficiencies, reduce accidents, and standardize workflows to reduce defects. The 
method is based on five steps:
  Sort
 (Seiri)
  Straighten
 (Seiton)
  Shine
 (Seiso)
  Standardize
 (Seiketsu)
  Sustain
 (Shitsuke)
 Phase I: Sort
 During the sort phase, all items or materials in a workspace are reviewed, removing unneeded items and 
keeping necessary resources. 
 Page | 
40  © 201

 Consider the copy room in an office: over the years, supplies, tools, and machinery have piled up. When 
going through the room, teams might decide that the stapler and 
Scotch tape stay; people still need to 
staple pages or access tape. The old paper cutter
 isn™t necessary for the team, since no one ever 
performs paper
-cutting duties. However, someone notes that the team in shipping and warehousing has 
to manually cut pages down sometimes, so the paper cutter is relocated to that department.  The team 

decide
s to toss a bin of miscellaneous loose paper and an old fax machine because a new copy machine 
includes fax capability. By eliminating obstacles and unnecessary items, costs, time, and employee 
frustration are also removed. 
 The sort step lets you take inv
entory of an area, discover unused or wasted resources, and make room 
for reorganization. Sort can also be applied with computerized processes.
 Phase 2: Straighten
 Once excess is removed from the work area, teams must provide a streamlined and easy
-to-use 
location 
for everything necessary to the workspace. During the straighten phase, every item, tool, or material is 
given a home. To facilitate ongoing organization, the location of resources should be labeled clearly. The 

idea is to create a workspace that 
anyone could use: if someone from another area comes to your copy 

room, it should only take a few seconds to locate the right size paper. Employees in a factory should be 
able to move from station to station, finding equipment and tools with 
ease. 
The
 goal is to provide the 
visual controls that allow for common
-sense operation. Labeling a shelf for letter
-sized paper, arranging 
sockets in size order in a drawer labeled sockets, or parking the forklift in a marked area of factory floor 
when not in us
e are all good examples. Labeling the stapler with a label maker is an example of things 
going beyond common sense: you don™t need to label items that most people in the workplace would 
recognize on site. 
 The straighten phase also works well in a digital 
environment, especially when computers or systems are 
used by a variety of people. In an office that has a shared workspace policy, computer desktops might be 
pushed out by technical resources so that the same programs are available to everyone. Not only a
re all 
programs the same, but the icons are in the same location on each desktop so users don™t have to 

search for programs if they move to a new workstation.
 Phase 3: Shine
 The third phase in the 5S methodology is targeted to keeping the workplace clean a
nd neat. Seiso can 
also be translated to ﬁsweep, sanitize, or scrub.ﬂ The goal is to shine the work space by cleaning it, 

maintaining equipment, and returning items to the proper place after use. In a computerized 
environment, the shine phase can be accomp
lished by naming files in a manner that makes them easy to 
locate, keeping folder structures intact, and deleting or archiving files that are no longer necessary.
 Shine can be applied to any environment, physical or digital. 
 Phase 4: Standardize
 The stand
ardize phase is used to maintain the progress achieved in all previous phases. By keeping high 
standards of orderliness in place, the benefits of the 5S methodology can be long
-term. The stress and 
speed of a daily workday can make it hard to keep up with 
the 5S standards. If everyone is committed to 
working together, the benefits can be ongoing.
  Page | 
41  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 Phase 5: Sustain
 5S only works if everyone on the team or within the organization commits to the process. Employees 
must follow the rules that are set up for stan
dardizing and sustaining the organization. Otherwise, the 
team enters a cycle of cleaning up after a period of failing to keep up with the standards of 5S. 
 The overall benefits the 5S 
method includes
:  Reduced risks of accidents and safety 
issues
  Increased compliance with regulations from organizations such as OSHA
  A foundation that makes additional improvements easier to implement
  Waste is easier to identify and eliminate
  Production and quality are generally improved
 All of these benefits t
ranslate to increased profits and customer satisfaction, which are the overall goals 

of the Six Sigma methodology.
 Just
-in-Time Manufacturing
  Just
-in-Time manufacturing, or JIT, is another Lean concept that originated with Toyota. Originally, JIT 
took a l
iteral meaning. The goal of JIT manufacturing was to produce an output ﬁjust in time,ﬂ or ﬁas 
neededﬂ by the customer. The customer was the person or process that required the output; 
sometimes, that meant the end customers, and, other times, the customer 
was a different employee or 

process within the organization.
 In a JIT processing situation, one machine might produce a part required by another machine. JIT 
manufacturing means that the first machine supplies only the amount of parts that the second machi
ne 
can process. If the second machine can process one part per minute, the first machine is set to produce 
one part per minute. You™ll recognize this idea from the sections on muda of inventory and 
overproduction.
 It™s obviously not always possible to run 
a process just
-in-time for the end customer, but most modern 
companies do try to come as close as possible. Using predictive analytics, companies attempt to 

estimate how many of each product will sell before they produce those products. In some cases, such
 as 
with book publishing, companies run a smaller number of items first. If those items sell well or sell out, 
the company orders bigger and bigger runs of the product.
 Some entrepreneurs have applied JIT manufacturing to DVD sales. These individuals and c
ompanies buy 
the rights to films that have never been released on DVD or Blu
-ray before. They usually go after low
-cost films that are likely to have a small cult or niche following. Because the demand is small, it isn™t 
feasible to print and market these 
DVDs in traditional fashion. However, the companies make a stable 
profit by selling the DVDs through online retailers such as Amazon.com and printing the DVDs to order. 

Modern technology lets this process occur with minimal expense and waiting.
 Today, JIT 
mentalities are less about the literal idea of providing the product just in time; rather, it has 
become a more general concept of Lean manufacturing that helps organizations eliminate waste in the 
process.

  Lean Concepts Crop Up in Many Improvement Method
ologies
 We™ve covered many of the high level Lean concepts, and you™ll see some of these concepts repeat 
throughout the rest of this book. While Six Sigma is concerned with improving processes and reducing 

defects, eliminating waste and increasing efficien
cies goes hand
-in-hand with these goals.

 Chapter 5: Basic Six Sigma Concepts
  In the last chapter, we covered some of the major concepts associated with Lean. In this chapter, we™ll 
look at some of the major concepts of the Six Sigma methodology. These,
 along with the concepts 
introduced in Chapter 1, are some of the building blocks used in improvement projects and statistical 

process control.
 Standard Deviation
 The driving goal of Six Sigma is to reduce defects. By reducing defects, teams can increase p
roductivity, 
decrease overall costs, increase customer satisfaction, and create maximum profit. One idea inherent in 
the Six Sigma methodology is that variance is the root of many defects. 
 For example, if an oven heats to exactly 350 degrees in five minut
es and stays at that temperature until 
it is turned off, it is less likely to burn cookies. If a cook measures each ingredient exactly, he or she is 
more likely to turn out cookies that consistently taste good. Add variation in the process, and 
consistency
 is lost. When consistency is lost, defects are introduced. If the oven doesn™t maintain an 
exact temperature all the time, the cookies might burn. If the cook puts in a cup of sugar instead of a 
cup and a half, the cookies might not be sweet enough. Varia
tion makes for inconsistent quality.
 It™s important to note that removing variation alone doesn™t always improve quality. What if the cook 

set the oven to 400 degrees all the time and only used half a cup of sugar for each batch? The process 
has no variati
on, and neither do the results. The cookies will always be bland and burnt.
 Six Sigma process improvement teams usually take a two
-step approach to improvements. First, they 
have to determine if the process is functional. In the cookie example, does the re
cipe work at all? Is 
there even a recipe? Once the team determines there is a workable recipe, they make improvements to 
remove the variation that causes outputs to deviate from the result intended by the recipe.
 The statistical measure used by teams to understand variation in a process is known as 
standard 
deviation. Standard deviation is represented in math by the lower case Greek 
letter S
igma 
Œ the
 you 
saw in
 Chapter 1.
 Standard deviation measures the distance
 between data points and the mean of all data. A large standard 
deviation means an overall wide spread of points; a smaller standard deviation means a closely clustered 
set of points.

   The image above provides a graphical representation of deviation. Im
agine the vertical axis is a measure 
of time and the horizontal axis is a measure of temperature. The center line in each image represents the 
mean temperature. You can see that the temperature over time varies much more in the figure on the right. 
 Calcul
ating Standard Deviation for Population Data
 Standard deviation is a statistical concept. The formula for standard deviation when dealing with data of 

the entire population is:
 =1()      Formula Key:
 
Standar
d deviation
  = mean 
 tells 
you to add up the results of all the calculations done for the items listed in the parentheses
 N =  the number of data elements for which you calculated 
standard deviation
 X =  a place holder for each data element
 Page | 
45  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
  You would use this formula if you ha
ve all the data elements of a population and not just a random 
sampling of data elements. For example, if you wanted to find out what the deviation was in the size of 
pizzas made, you could ask staff to measure each pizza before serving it. You would have 
the data for 
the entire population of pizzas for the day, so you could use the equation above. However, if you 
wanted to calculate standard deviation when you have sample data, you would use the equation from 
the next section.
 If you™re new to statistics, 
the equation for standard deviation looks complicated. We™ll break it down 
and run through some exercises on calculating standard deviation manually, but in practice, you will 
usually use a statistical software tool to make this calculation automatically.
 For our explanation, we™ll use a data set from a teacher. She wants to find the standard deviation of 
scores on the latest test. The scores from her class of 15 students are:
 67, 68, 73, 74, 81, 85, 88, 88, 90, 90, 90, 93, 94, 98, 99
 1. Calculate the mean.
 To begin the standard deviation calculation, you need to know the mean for the population. The mean is 
represented mathematically by the Greek letter mu, or 
. Mean is calculated by adding all of the 
numbers and dividing that sum by the number of items in
 a data set. In this case, there are 15 items.
 67 + 68 + 73 + 74 + 81 + 85 + 88 + 88 + 90 + 90 + 90 + 93 + 94 + 98 + 99 = 1278
 1193/15 = 85.2
 2. Subtract the mean and square it.
 The formula calls for you to take each number in the data set, subtract the 
mean from it, and square the 
result. The first number is 67, so:
 67 Œ 85.2 = 
-18.2
 -18.2 * 
-18.2 = 331.24
 If you apply that concept to all 15 numbers, you end up with a list of results:
 331.24
 295.84
 148.84
 
125.44
 17.64
 0.04

 60.84 77.44
 163.84
 190.44
  
3. Find the mean of the results.
  The rest of the formula under the square root sign simply tells you to add up all the numbers you just 
calculated and divide by N, where N is the number of items in your data set. Or, to put it anot
her way, 
you need to find the mean of the new numbers you just calculated. 
  The sum of the numbers above is 1496.4.  
  1496.4 / 15 = 99.76
  This new number, 99.76, is called the variance.
  4. Find the square root of the variance.
 The standard deviation is
 the square root of the variance. In this case, the square root of 99.76, which is 
9.987.
  
The standard deviation for the test scores 
is 9.987.
  Calculating Standard Deviation with Sample Data
  While statistics based on total population data are always more accurate than those based on sample 
data, you™ll probably work from sample data more often. It just becomes too expensive or even 

impossible to get population data for many elements. Sometimes
, the data is measuring events or states 
over time, which means population data doesn™t exist. For example, if you wanted to understand 
temperature fluctuations in a warehouse, you might record the temperature at a certain location every 
ten minutes. After
 several days, you have sufficient sample data to analyze. 
  Other examples of sample data include:
  A random sample of reasons for denied medical claims
  Measurements for river height taken three times per day for a month
 The formula for standard deviation 
based on sample data is:
 =11()  Page |

  Since mu is the mean of 
population
 data, it™s been replaced in this formula with x
-bar, which is the 
average of the data points in your sample. Sigma has b
een replaced with s, but the only math
ematical
 difference is that you divide by N
-1 instead of N to get the variance as a way to make up for some of the 
accuracy lost in using a sampling.
 Using the same data from the population example above, let™s assume 
that the 15 grades the teacher 
had were a random sampling from all of her classes. The only difference in the math would come in the 
second to last step, where we divide by 14 instead of 15, so:
 1496.4 / 14 = 106.885
  The square root of 106.885 is 10.338, 
which would be the standard deviation for the sample.
   Standard Deviation in Excel
 Admittedly, if you™re calculating standard deviation by hand, it™s a lot of arithmetic. Luckily, once the 
statistical concepts behin
d the numbers are understood, statistical analysis software, such as Excel and 
Minitab, can 
be 
used to accurately crunch numbers. Standard deviation is automatically calculated in 
most statistical analysis software programs by clicking a button after you e
nter your data sets. The 
standard deviation is also calculated automatically by such software programs when you initiate other 

calculations that require standard deviation. We™ll look at some of these functions more in
-depth in the 
chapters on using Excel 
add
-ons and Minitab for statistical analysis.
 See for yourself:
 Lab techs are measuring the response of bacteria to an ingredient in a potential treatment. They 

want to know how long it takes bacteria to show a response. Sample data for response
 times in 
minutes is:
 2, 3.5, 2.3, 2, 2.5, 3.1, 2.2, 3.2, 4
 Calculate the standard deviation.

 In the meantime, you can quickly calculate standard deviation in Excel using the standard deviation 
function. To do so:
 1. Enter your data set in a column
   2. In a new cell, enter =STDEV()
  3. Select the cells with 
data you want to calculate standard deviation for.
    4. Hit enter
   Note: The formula in Excel calculates a sample standard deviation using the N
-1 math, which means you 
can use this formula for samples and not for populations.
  Why Calculate Standard 
Deviation?
 Standard deviation gives you an idea of how much variation actually exists in a process while taking 
outliers somewhat into account. In the example of the grades from above, the sample standard 

deviation indicates that most of the grades are goi
ng to fall within 10.33 points on either side of the 

average. 
 That tells the teacher that students have a fairly wide performance on her test. If the results were an 

average score of 90 with a standard deviation of 3, he or she might assume that students 
in class were

 learning and retaining the knowledge as expected. If the average score was 64 with a standard deviation 
of 2, then he or she might assume students in class were not retaining the knowledge as expected or 
there was some issue with 
the 
test str
ucture. Both of these situations indicate a small variance in the 
way students are performing, which points to the success or problem being tied to the class, the 
teaching, or the test.
 On the other hand, if the average score was 60 with a standard deviati
on of 30, then some students 
were performing very well while others were performing poorly. This might indicate to the teacher that 
some students are falling behind. If he or she took samples from several classes, he or she might 

investigate and realize th
at the lowest scores were mostly from one class, which could indicate that he 
or she forgot to adequately cover a certain concept in that class.
 Standard deviation alone serves as a pointer for where to investigate within the process for problems or 
soluti
ons
. Another reason to calculate it is because it is involved in many of the other statistical 
processes we cover in later chapters. Standard deviation becomes an important concept in both analysis 
and statistical process control and often serves as the st
arting point for further Statistical Six Sigma 
analysis.
  
 The Pareto Principle
 The Pareto principle, also called the 80/20 rule, says that 20 percent of the causes lead to 80 percent of 

the effects. This there is also called the law of the vital few: the 
vital few inputs drive the majority of the 

outputs. 
 The Pareto principle was first suggested by a management consultant named Joseph Juran. Juran named 

the principle for Vilfredo Pareto, an economist in Italy who wrote that 20 percent of the nation™s peop
le 
owned 80 percent of its land. The principle has become common in various circles. Business 
professionals commonly state that 80 percent of sales come from 20 percent of customers, and 
volunteer organizations usually operate with 20 percent of the people
 doing 80 percent of the work.
 The principle is critical to Six Sigma not because causes and effects line up nicely via an 80/20 
breakdown, but because it almost universally applies that a few inputs create more impact than all of 
the other inputs. Individ
uals seeking to reduce defects can almost always identify three to four inputs 
that, if improved, will create dramatic impact on the outcome. While resources, costs, and difficulty of 

improvements also play a role in solution selections, understanding whic
h inputs or root causes are high 
on a Pareto chart let project teams determine where improvements will make the biggest impact to the 

bottom line.
 The Pareto principle is best displayed using a Pareto chart, which is a graphical representation of data 
elem
ents 
Œ usually inputs or causes 
Œ in a ranked bar chart. Unlike a regular bar chart, the bars are 
arranged in order of height, with the highest on the left and the lowest on the right. Statistical software 
used to create such charts adds formatting and oth
er elements automatically, but you can also create a 
basic Pareto chart in Excel.

 To illustrate the Pareto principle, we™ll look at a common situation involving defects in the medical 
field
Šspecifically in the process for submitting medical claims. Payers
 often deny claims, and they do so 
for a variety of reasons. When claims are denied, provider offices have to rework, resubmit, or appeal 
the denials. Some denial reasons are not appealable, which means the provider™s office loses the 
revenue associated wi
th the claim.
 We™ll imagine a medical office that is experiencing a cash flow problem because of claim denials. The 
office gathers data about the denials and creates a Pareto chart so the team can see where the bulk of 
the denials are coming from. The data
 is listed below, followed by a basic Pareto chart created in Excel.

    From the Pareto chart, you can see that the top three denial reasons account for 80 percent of the 
denied claims. An experienced billing team could tell you three things just from looking at this data:
 1. The 
office has muda of rework. They are sending a large percentage of claims more than one 
time.
 2. The office has an efficiency problem. Almost a fourth of their claims are not making it to the 
payer prior to timely filing deadlines.

 3. The office has an insurance
 verification problem, because a fifth of their claims are being sent 
with information that doesn™t match anything on the payer™s end.
 Addressing duplicate claims is important because it reduces rework and could enhance the office™s 
relationship with insur
ance companies. However, the team might choose to work on the timely filing 

problem first because timely filing denials are final, which means the office is losing the revenue 
associated with all those claims. Filing claims on time is not difficult in many
 cases, given the fact that 
most payers allow months or even a year for claims to be filed, so this could be an ﬁeasyﬂ win for the 
team. A Pareto chart often uncovers low
-hanging fruit in this manner.
 Creating a Basic Pareto Chart in Excel
 If you don™t hav
e statistical software, you can create a basic Pareto chart like the one above in Excel. Use 
the claims denial data or data of your own to practice making a Pareto chart.
 1. Create a column for the data labels. Pareto charts work well when you have quantifiab
le causes 
for a defect or other effect. In the example, the data labels are the reason for the denial. No 
matter what type of data you are using, enter it in order from largest to smallest for Pareto 
chart purposes.
 2. Create a column for count. Enter the 
total for each cause in that column.
 3. Create a column for cumulative count. This column provides a running total. You can calculate 
the numbers manually or us
ing
 Excel. In the data table below, you would set C3 = B3. In C4, you 
would enter the formula =C3+B
4. You can drag that formula down and Excel will change the 
references for each cell so you get =C4+B5, =C5+B6–and so forth.
 4. Create a column for percent. In the data table below, the formula for D3 is =B3/$C$9.  Cell C9 
has the total of all denials, so we 
want to divide each individual denial total by C9. The dollar 
signs in the formula let you copy it into each lower cell. The first reference will change, moving 
to the next line, but the dollar signs tell Excel to keep the C9 reference for each calculation
. The 
final result is a table that looks like this:
 Reason
 Count
 Cumulative

  Use of Pareto 
Charts
 Pareto charts are helpful analytical tools when you need to analyze frequencies or causes of problems. 
They also help narrow an approach for a problem that has many causes or is too broad to address in a 
single improvement project. Like the claims d
enials example above, you can find a single cause to work 
on that can yield large results across the entire process. 
 Pareto charts are also helpful when communicating information about causes to others, especially those 
outside of the Six Sigma process. A
lthough Pareto charts are a powerful analytical tool, they also 
represent complex data in a visual format that is familiar to most anyone. Business professionals know 
how to read a bar chart, and putting the chart in order only makes it easier for individu
als to see the 
true causes behind issues. For this reason, many Six Sigma experts regularly include Pareto charts when 
presenting to business leaders and others, especially if the data might be considered surprising or need 
visual reinforcement. 
 Voice of 
the Customer
 Voice of the Customer, or VOC, is a foundational concept in many quality programs. The goal of quality is 

to make a better, more consistent product. One of the ways you know you™ve reached this goal is that 
your customers will be more consiste
ntly satisfied. The only way to reach this goal is to seek feedback 
from the customer, making VOC data critical to collect before, during, and after improvement projects.
 Page | 
55  © 201

 Successful VOC programs are proactive and constant in their desire for feedback, and 
technology makes 
it possible to seek customer feedback in numerous ways. Some methods for capturing feedback include:
  Surveys via telephone, mail, email, or online
  Focus groups in person or online
  Interviews
  Beta or user testing
  Feedback forms
  Customer com
plaints
  Social media or site interaction
  Reviews
  Forums
 The VOC can be sought as a means to clarify needs and desires, clarify specific problems with a process, 
or as a regular part of improvement, customer service, and marketing agendas. 
 Building a VOC C
ampaign
 Asking the right questions, in the right way, helps you create powerful VOC campaigns that provide 
useable data for Six Sigma teams. We™ll talk about two specific types of VOC campaigns in this section: 

general customer feedback and specific custom
er feedback.
 General Feedback 
 General customer feedback is often obtained through feedback forms, customer complaint records, and 
passive information gathering via websites or social media. Through such methods, organizations are 
usually testing general 
waters to get a temperature reading: are customers happy overall, dissatisfied 
overall, and is there any direction as to the cause of customer feelings
? Pick up a feedback form in any fast food restaurant or access the online survey usually linked to on a 
receipt and you™ll get a good idea of the type of information sought in general VOC campaigns. 
 Kroger, a grocery store chain in the United States, includes a link to a survey on most of its receipts. The 
survey first asks for the date, time, and an entry 
code from the receipt. This helps the 
company 
know 
where and when a person shopped so they can attribute feedback to the right location and staff. 
 Next, the Kroger survey asks 
in 
which areas of the store a person shopped. The rest of the survey asks 
speci
fic questions about each area of the store a person visited, including:
  What was the overall satisfaction with the store?
  What was the customer™s satisfaction with:
 o Employee friendliness
 o Prices
 o Service
 o Cleanliness
 o Items being available
 o Weekly specials
 o Ease
 of movement
 o Quality of brands
 Page |

 o Check out times
  Whether the shopper is likely to recommend the store to another person in the next 30 days.
 These questions are designed to ga
uge general customer feelings on critical quality elements for the 
store. Understan
ding your critical to quality factors, or CTQs, is important to designing a strong VOC 
campaign. We™ll cover CTQs more in depth in Chapter 8.  
 General VOC feedback is often used as a smoke alarm. A smoke alarm is designed to alert individuals in a 
busines
s, home, or other building that the possibility of a fire exists. Smoke alarms are set at a sensitive 
level, so they go off when smoke is present and people within the building can take action. Often, the 
alarm and early action saves lives an
d can even red
uce damage associated with a potential fire.
 VOC data can work the same way. If numbers change suddenly in a certain area, an organization knows 

to look deeper into the issue. It™s an indicator that a problem could exist; early investigation and action 
can
 help prevent problems from becoming bigger or more costly. For example, if a certain Kroger store 
always scored high in cleanliness
, and the numbers dropped consistently across a month, then store 
management might need to revisit maintenance and cleaning 
training.
 Results from general VOC feedback are also used in some organizations as an indicator of quality for 
certain employees. Sales and services staff are often rewarded financially and in other ways for high 

customer satisfaction scores. This also inc
reases employee drive and satisfaction.
 Specific Feedback
 Sometimes, organizations want feedback that is specific to a problem, product, or idea. The same tools 
used in general feedback campaigns can be used in specific campaigns, but you can also tailor t
he VOC 
tool to the need. If you want feedback about a new app, you could use a beta test. If you want to test a 
product, idea, or marketing campaign, an in
-person or online focus group might be best. 
 For specific feedback, you have to ask specific questio
ns. This is especially true if you are seeking 
additional information or clarification of general feedback. For example, if Kroger did see a problem with 
ratings on cleanliness, it might want more information about how and where customers note 
uncleanlines
s. Without additional feedback, managers might have staff mopping the floors more when 
customers really felt the store was dirty because of a lack of lighting or because shel
ve
s were stocked in 
a sloppy manner. 
 Selecting the Right VOC Tools
 Getting the ri
ght type of feedback
Šand keeping costs and timelines within budget

the right VOC tool for your project. The table below rates each tool on relative cost and provides some 
brief pros and cons.

  The Likert Scale
 When designing your own VOC tool, keep in mind how
 you intend to use the information gained. If you 
want to input data into statistical analysis software to test hypothesis or create visual charts, then you 
need to ask questions that yield actual data points that can be analyzed using statistics. A popula
r way 
to do this is with a Likert Scale.
 Using a Likert Scale, you would frame all questions so they are answered via a 5
-point ranking. The 
ranking can be any number of things, but most commonly is some variation of:
 - Strongly agree
 - Agree
 - Neutral
 - Disagree
 - Strongly disagree
 The answers are coded with numbers when data is entered into statistical software. For example, an 
answer of strongly agree might be coded as 10. Agree would be 7, neutral 5, disagree 3, and strongly 
disagree 1. By using numerical data, y
ou can easily create charts and graphs and run more in
-depth 
statistical analysis, which is covered in future chapters.
 Basic Metrics
 We introduced some ideas about Six Sigma metrics in Chapter 1 when we talked about sigma level and 
defects per million opportunities, or DPMO. Metrics are extremely utilized when applying Six Sigma to 
processes and improvements, requiring that anyone worki
ng in a Six Sigma environment be familiar with 
them. 
 Defects per Million Opportunities
 Many Six Sigma metrics come with an equation, just like standard deviation. For example, the equation 
for DPMO is:
 (number of defects in a sample/opportunities for a de
fect in the sample) * 1,000,000
 For example, if a mail
-order retailer examines quality of the order process, it might sample forms 
entered by customer service representatives. If each form 
has 10 fields, then there are 10 opportunities 
for an error on each
 form. If the retailer reviews 90 forms, then there are 10 * 90, or 900, total 
opportunities for errors.
 Page | 
59  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 During the review, the retailer finds 2 errors, or defects. To calculate DPMO, the math would be as 
follows:
 (2/900) * 1,000,000 = 2,222 defects per mi
llion opportunities. 
  Defects per Unit
 DPU is a measure of how many defects there are in relation to the number of units tested. DPU is 
concerned with total defects, and one unit could have more than one defect. The formula for DPU is:
 Number of defects f
ound / number of units in the sample
  For example, if a publisher printed 1,000 books and pulled out 50 books for quality checks, it might be 
looking for the following defects:
 - Incorrect printing
 - Incorrect ali
gnment 
 - Missing pages
 - A lo
ose spine
 - Torn cover
 Out of 50 books, the publisher discovers:
 - 3 books are missing pages
 - 1 book is missing pages and has a torn cover
 - 2 books have lo
ose spines
 - 1 book has incorrect printing and incorrect ali
gnment
 There are 9 total errors, as two books had two defects each.
 The DPU is calculated by dividing defects by number of units sampled. In this case, 9/50 = 0.18.
 DPU provides an average level of quality
Šit tells you how many defects on average each unit can be 
expected to have. In this case, that is 0.18 defects on aver
age.
 First Time Yield (FTY)
 First time yield is the ratio of units produced to units attempted to produce. For example, if you put 12 
cookies in the oven, but only 10 come out edible, then you haven™t produced 12 cookies.
 The formula for FTY is:
 Number of 
good units produced / number of units entering the process
 In the cookie example, the FTY is 10/12, or .833.
 Most products or services are created via multiple processes; you multiply the FTY for each process to 
calculate an overall FTY.  For example, cons
ider the following process chain:
 - 100 units enter process A and 95 units exit.
 Page | 
60  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 - 95 units enter process B and 85 good units are achieved.
 - 85 units enter process C and 80 good units exit.
 The FTY would be calculated as follows:
 - 95/100 = 0.95 = FTY of process 
A - 85/95 = 0.89 = FTY of process B
 - 80/85 = 0.94 = FTY of process C
 - 0.95 * 0.89 * 0.94 = 0.79
 The overall FTY of the process is 0.79.
  Rolled Throughput Yield (RTY)
 The rolled throughput yield, or RTY, provides a probability that a unit will be generated by 
a process with 
no defects. One of the main differences between RTY and basic yield or first time yield is that RTY 
considers whether rework was needed to generate the number of final units. This is a valuable concern, 
because organizations don™t always thi
nk about the rework that is inherent in a process, which means 
they often measure a process and deem it successful even if muda is present.
 RTY is calculated in a similar manner to FTY, but it takes rework into account. If process A from the FTY 
example on
ly achieved a yield of 95 because someone reworked five items to make them good, then 
RTY calculations add five instances of rework into the ratio. The formula is:
 (Number of units entering 
-  (scrap + rework))/number of units entering process
 In the case 
of process A: (100  
- (5+5))/100 = 90/100 = 0.9
 Consider the following process chain:
 - 100 units enter process A. 
Five are scrapped, 5 are reworked
, and a total of 95 are produced.
 - 95 units enter process B. Ten are scrapped,
 5 are reworked, and a total of 85 are produced.
 - 85 units enter process C. Five are scrapped, 15 are reworked, and a total of 80 are produced.
 The RTY is calculated as follows:
 - 100 
Œ (5 + 5) = 90, 90/100 = 0.9 RTY for A
 - 95 Œ (10 + 5) = 80, 80/95 = 0.84 RTY
 for B
 - 85 Œ (5 + 15) = 65, 65/85 = 0.76 RTY for C
 - 0.9 * 0.84 * 0.76 = 0.574

 The overall RTY for the process is 0.574, which is a much lower rate than when you look at FTY alone. 
RTY d
oesn™t provide an indication of final production or sales, but a low RTY indicates that there is waste 
in the process in the form of rework.

 A government agency handles applications for assistance for local families. The process for each 
application includes:
 -A representative enters the family™s inf
ormation into a computer system
 -A separate staff member reviews the information and uses an income scale to determine if the 
family is eligible for any assistance
 -The second staff member sends the family a letter stating their options for assistance
 All of
 the applications and customer feedback for March were reviewed, and the team found the 
following information:
 -643 families sought assistance in March
 -3 families were not able to complete the application process because the representative took 
too long to 
see them
 -50 applications could not be passed to the second rep because of incomplete information
 -45 applications did not have complete information at first but that information was later 

received 
 -The second staff member was able to process all completed a
pplications she received
 -Of all letters that went out to families, 10 included incorrect information
 Calculate the FTY and the RTY for this process.

 Chapter 6: Approaching the Problem
  Understanding how to approach the problem 
Œ beginning to identify the problem and defining it with a 
statement 
Œ is critical to creating a foundation for successful Six Sigma projects. In later chapters, we™ll 
cover the importance of defining a variety of 
project, process, and problem aspects, but in this chapter, 
we™re going to discuss the project in general, digging deeper via a series of why questions, and creating a 

general problem statement as a launching point for a project. 
 Problem Functions: y = f(
x)
 Because Six Sigma approaches things with a statistical mindset, it considers all problems as a function. 
Using mathematical symbols, this looks like:
  The y=f(x) statement can be used in two ways. First, it is a general map for stating a problem. Y 
(the 
problem) occurs because some X (input or cause) is occurring. In reality, Y is usually occurring because of 
some group of causes or inputs, which means there are going to be more than one X inputs.
 The idea can also be applied to specific processes an
d outcomes within the problem. As you get more 
and more granular, the y=f(x) concept becomes increasingly mathematical; in many cases, you can graph 
the relationship between the output (y) and the input (x). 
 To understand the concept of thinking of problems as a function, let™s look at a problem that might 

occur for a large HVAC service provider. The manager of a service team has discovered that s
ervice calls 
are taking much longer than expected; in fact, his five team members take 1.75 times longer on average 
than other service reps in the company to handle all types of calls.
 To find out what might be causing the situation, the manager researches
 the problem by talking to the 
reps, talking to the customers, and going out on random calls with all five representatives. He makes the 
following observations:
 Page | 
63  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
  One representative is a native to the area the team services, which means he or she knows 
many 
of the customers personally. This results in friendly chatter that lengthens the time on the 
job.
  One representative is providing homeowners with very in
-depth explanations and education 
about HVAC issues, sometimes over and beyond what the homeowner would
 ever need to know 
regarding his or her HVAC unit.
  One representative is new to the job and takes longer to complete each task because he or she 
is unsure of 
the 
work, has to 
double
-check
 the 
work, or calls another rep to ask questions about 
the
 work.
  The remaining two reps perform work in times that are on par with company averages.
 The manager distills this data down to two overall causes for the problem:
  Too much talking (reps one and two)
  Inadequate training
 The problem can now be stated as a
 function:
  The extra time is a function of too much talking and inappropriate training.
 The manager also now has two root causes to address. The example is simple, but it illustrates the basic 

concept in defining a y=f(x) relationship for a problem and it
s causes. It™s not always so easy to conduct 
the research and analysis to find the relationship, but the relationship is 
always
 present.
 Some other examples of y=f(x) relationships include:
  Low customer satisfaction with hamburger taste is a function of an
 uncalibrated grill.
  Low employee morale is a function of a poor time
-off approval system.
  Customer wait times are a function of technology distractions for employees.
  The 5 Whys
 Data analysis is one of the best ways to validate a y=f(x) assumption, but t
eams who are familiar with 
processes can often arrive at some basic relationships through a process known as the 5 Whys. This is a 

brainstorming tool that asks increasingly granular why questions about a problem or process, seeking to 
understand the root c
ause or actual problem. The 5 Whys can be used to define a problem or to begin 
seeking causes.
 For example, consider the hamburger example above. Teams addressing a problem of customer 
satisfaction might begin doing so because feedback forms have shown a l
ower
-than
-normal satisfaction 
with food quality over the past week. 
 The team first asks: 
Why are customers dissatisfied with the food?
 Looking at feedback tied to orders, the team notes that the customers who are rating the food poorly 
are mostly customer
s who ordered hamburgers of some type. The answer to the first question is that 
the customers are dissatisfied with the food because they are dissatisfied with the hamburgers.
 Page | 
64  © 201

 Why are customers dissatisfied with hamburgers?
 The team looks at written feedba
ck on forms or speaks with customers directly and discovers that many 
customers feel that their hamburgers were undercooked. The new answer is that customers are 
dissatisfied with hamburgers because the meat is undercooked.
 Why is the meat undercooked?
 An 
investigation into the kitchen reveals that the grill is not properly calibrated and is providing 
inconsistent results. At this point, you have the y=f(x) relationship, but the team could keep asking 
questions.
 Why is the grill not properly calibrated?
 Fur
ther investigation shows that the morning shift, responsible for calibrating the grill, has a new grill 
cook. During training, education on performing this function was omitted. The grill is not properly 
calibrated because the employee responsible was not 
properly trained. Now the team has a specific 
cause and a solution: train the grill cook.
 In a Six Sigma environment, the team might move on with one more question: Why was the grill cook 
not properly trained? This might lead to the development of a consis
tent training policy so the problem 
doesn™t occur the next time a new grill cook is hired. 
 In the hamburger example, it only took four why questions to get to the root of the problem, and a fifth 

question started pointing to controls or long
-term solution
s. It isn™t always this easy; the tool is called 
the 5 Whys because it often leads to answers within five questions. However, teams could ask a dozen 

questions if they begin at a very high level and work down through a complex process.
 When to Use 5 Whys
  One benefit of 5 Whys is that it only costs your team a small amount of time to use
Ša team familiar 
with a process can conduct a complete 5 Whys session in less than an hour if a moderator keeps things 

on task. Because of its simplicity, the 5 Whys tool ca
n be used for almost any problem. Use it to address 
a problem team members bring up, to address a problem a supervisor noticed, or to address the vague 
feeling that there is a problem when no one has been able to define what is actually wrong. At the very 
least, a 5 Whys session facilitates communication and thought.
 In a Six Sigma project environment, 5 Whys is usually deployed when processes involve human 
interactions or people
-powered inputs, though it can be an effective start to brainstorming on any 
pr
ocess.
 Conducting a 5 Whys Session
 Since a 5 Whys session is usually based on input from subject
-matter
-experts, gather people who are 
close to the process. On a white board or web conference screen, display a basic problem statement as 
you understand it. 
This problem statement is not going to be detailed like the statements we™ll discuss in 
the next session
Ša 5 Whys session is often one of the tools you use to get to that detailed statement.
 Examples of statements you might see in a 5 Whys station include:
  Customers are not happy with the selection of produce
 Page | 
65  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
  Customers are receiving orders late
  The printing process is resulting in too many defects
  Lead times on the bottling process are excessive
  Employees are not happy with vacation schedules
 These are all 
fairly general statements that simply say something about defects or dissatisfaction. Begin 
by asking the highest
-level ﬁWhy?ﬂ question possible about the statement. ﬁWhy are employees not 
happy with vacation schedules?ﬂ Write this question down.
 The team 
works together to provide a high level answer to the question. Employees are not happy with 

vacation schedules because it™s rare to get the exact time off requested. Write the answer down under 
the question, then create the highest
-level ﬁWhy?ﬂ question yo
u can about the new answer.
 ﬁWhy are employees not getting their first choice time off for vacation?ﬂ Perhaps the answer is that 
supervisors take so long to approve vacation requests that other employees have also asked off for the 

same time, so it™s hard 
for supervisors to accommodate everyone.
 The next question is ﬁWhy are supervisors taking too long to approve requests?ﬂ The answer might be 

that the time
-off system is too cumbersome, so supervisors put off approvals until they have a lot of 
time to manag
e them. 
 ﬁWhy do supervisors see the system as cumbersome?ﬂ Because there are wait times when moving from 
screen to screen and each approval requires a vast number of clicks and entries. 
 Now, the team has a root cause: the system itself is inefficient, wh
ich leads to problems down the line. If 
the team can correct the programing issues and encourage supervisors to approve vacation requests 
faster, employee morale can be improved.
   Creating a Problem Statement
 A Six Sigma improvement project usually starts
 with a formal project statement. This is different from 
the basic statements used to launch a 5 Whys session. A strong problem statement is similar to a 30
-second elevator pitch, which executives and sales people across the globe use to hook clients or 
bu
siness investors on an idea. The problem statement, like that pitch, provides enough information that 
a busy executive can understand what the issue is and why there is a need for an improvement effort. 
 Project statements should include:
  Where and when th
e problem was recorded or was occurring
  A measurement of magnitude for the problem, preferably with some tie to cost
  A brief description of the problem that could be understood by professionals not closely aligned 

with the process (avoid too many niche wor
ds and acronyms if you will be presenting 
information to non
-niche professionals)
  A brief notation about the metric used to measure or describe the problem

 Example of a Strong Problem Statement
 In the first quarter, the California distribution center sent 
108,000 packages. Of those packages, 15,000 
were returned, resulting in a 13.8 percent return rate. The rate of return is above the accepted 7 percent 
rate and cost the company an additional $372,000 for the quarter. Over the course of the year, the 
curren
t process could result in additional costs of over $1.4 million.
 This problem statement covers all the basic information:
  When? During the first quarter of this year.
  Where? The California distribution center
  What? Returns
  How many? 15,000, or 6.8 percent 
above expectations
  What is the magnitude? The cost could be $1.4 million a year
 The problem statement doesn™t talk about solutions or provide too many details. This is a strong 
problem statement because it answers all the basic questions 
and it provides a 
significant reason for 
leadership to invest interest: $1.4 million a year is a big loss.
  Example of a Weak Problem Statement
 The Canton, Ohio bakery is producing undercooked bread. Customer dissatisfaction with the bread is 
resulting in returns and bad 
word of mouth. The bread is supposed to be baked at 350 degrees for 40 
minutes.
 This statement introduces a problem, but it doesn™t provide details about when the problem occurred, 
how it was measured, and what the true magnitude is. The problem statement 
also begins going into 
possible root causes when it includes how the bread should be baked; the problem statement isn™t the 

place to begin this type of analysis.
 This statement might be better framed as:
 In November and December 2014, customer satisfaction
 complaints were traced back to bread baked in 
the Canton, Ohio facility. The facility produced 300,000 loaves during that time period and received 
50,000 complaints of bread being undercooked. Bread returns and loss of sales related to quality are 
estimat
ed to be $125,000 per month.
 Writing Your Own Problem Statement
 When you first start writing problem statements, it™s sometimes harder than you might expect to get all 
the information into a couple of sentences. To avoid leaving out information, it helps t
o use a list and to 
consider yourself a problem
-statement journalist.
 When journalists write a report, they are looking to answer some specific questions: What happened? 
Who did it happen to? When did it happen? Why does the audience care? 
 The same is tru
e when you are writing a problem statement. Follow the problem statement checklist:
 o Where did the problem occur?
 o When did the problem occur?
 Page | 
67  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 o What process did the problem involve?
 o How is the problem measured?
 o How much is the problem costing (in money, time,
 customer satisfaction, or another critical 
metric)?
 Use the checklist to construct the problem statement, and then ask yourself: Could someone else 
answer all the questions in the checklist from your problem statement alone? Before you present your 
statem
ent to a boss or other decision
-maker, test it out with a coworker or someone who is not as 
familiar with the issue as you are.
 Here are two problem statements. See if you can answer all of the questions in the checklist just using 

the information provided
. Problem Statement 1
 The call center in Jacksonville, Florida, handled 36,000 calls in February 2015. Of those calls, 8,000 had 
an average speed of answer (ASA) over the contract
-required 15 seconds. Those 8,000 service
-level
-agreement violations resulted
 in costs of $200,000.
 Problem Statement 2
 The call center in Ohio has a service
-level
-agreement issue that is costing approximately $9,000 per day.
  Problem statement 1 answers all of the questions on the checklist:
 o Where did the problem occur? Jacksonvil
le, Florida
 o When did the problem occur? February 2015
 o What process did the problem involve? Answering phone calls
 o How is the problem measured? Average speed of answer
 o How much is the problem costing (in money, time, customer satisfaction, or another 
critical 
metric)? $200,000 per month
 Problem statement 2 does not answer all of the questions:
 o Where did the problem occur? Ohio
 o When did the problem occur? Unknown 
 o What process did the problem involve? Unknown
 o How is the problem measured? Unknown
 o How muc
h is the problem costing (in money, time, customer satisfaction, or another critical 
metric)? $9,000 per month
 Problem statement 2 would benefit from adding a place, a specific reference to a process, and a specific 
metric.
 Problem Statements Lead to Objec
tive Statements/Goals
 Another way to tell you have a strong problem statement is that you can create an overall project 
objective statement or goal directly from the problem statement. Consider the two examples above.
 The team working with problem statemen
t 1 might create an objective that states: 
 Page | 
68  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 The goal is to reduce answer speed SLA violations in the Jacksonville call center by 50 percent within 
three months. The potential savings to the company is $100,000 per month.
 The team working with problem 
statement 2 would not be able to create a goal statement with this 

much detail. They would simply be able to say they hope to reduce the service
-level
-agreement 
violations in the facility.
 Specific problem and objective statements are critical to Six Sigma
 project success for several reasons. 
First, being as specific as possible sets up appropriate expectations. In the first example, leadership has a 

specific expectation of the project: the team is going to work to reduce average speed of answer, and 
succes
s is a reduction of 50 percent. No one is going to expect the team to solve another problem, such 
as customer satisfaction with phone operators. That is out of scope for this project.
 In the second situation, the problem and goal statements are not specifi
c enough. What SLA violations is 
the team addressing? What, exactly, does success look like? Is the team expected to reduce costs 
completely? Not being specific enough sets you up for failure. Leadership might expect you to address 

service
 level
 agreements
 that have to do with how reps route phone calls, but you are only intending to 
address service
 level
 agreements that relate to the speed with which calls are answered. Leadership 
might think success is a 75 percent reduction in costs when you intend to wo
rk toward a 25 percent 
reduction.
 Creating strong problem statements lays a stable foundation for the rest of your project, gives the team 
a beacon when they get overwhelmed with information, and reduces the chance of scope creep and 
misunderstanding.
 Scop
e and Scope Creep
 Scope is the definition of what is included 
Œ and what is not included 
Œ in a process or improvement 
project. 
You
 begin defining scope with your problem statement. The informa
tion you include in the 
statement gives clues to what you will be working on, and the goal statement provides appropriate 
limits on the work to be done. 
 Six Sigma projects are not everlasting initiatives, though the culture of improvement that comes from 
Six 
Sigma is. This means your individual project needs a specific, challenging, but attainable goal. Once that 
goal is met, the project is concluded and you begin looking for a new problem to improve upon.
 Scope creep occurs when teams look to make infinit
e perfections on a process, attempt to reach 
unrealistic goals, or begin to reach for processes or problems that are out of the original scope. For 
example, consider the problem statement from one of our examples in this chapter: 
 In the first quarter, the
 California distribution center sent 108,000 packages. Of those packages, 15,000 
were returned, resulting in a 13.8 percent return rate. The rate of return is above the accepted 7 percent 
rate and cost the company an additional $372,000 for the quarter. Ov
er the course of the year, the 
current process could result in additional costs of over $1.4 million.
 A related goal statement might be:
 The goal is to reduce the return rate to the accepted 7 percent and save the company $372,000 per 

quarter.

 In scope for
 this project are processes related to shipping and returns only insomuch that they impact 
the return process. At some point, the team might stumble upon a packing process that is using too 
much material, thus costing the company an additional $50,000 per 
month. Unless the packing process 
is causing the returns
Šwhich is not likely in this situation
Šthis issue is not in scope for the team and 
they should not seek to fix it. The team can, however, note the issue or report it so that a future project 
might be 
launched to address the problem.
 It takes discipline and organization to address only that which is in scope for a project. 
Understanding 
the relationship b
etween problems and inputs and knowing how to create a strong problem statement 
are the first steps to controlling an improvement process.

 Unit 2: Projects and Processes
 Chapter 7: What is a Process?
  In Unit 1, we introduced Six Sigma as a concept and
 covered a lot of principles that are 
foundational to creating and maintaining improvement in a business. In Unit 2, we™ll begin 
looking at what a process is, why quality is important in a process, and how Six Sigma projects 

can improve processes. The conc
epts you learn in Units 1 and 2 become the bricks used to build 
project work that we discuss throughout the rest of the book.
 What is a Process?
 A process is a collection of tasks, steps, or activities that are performed, usually in a specific order, and 
result in an end product such as a tangible good or the provision of a service. In a business, multiple 
processes work together to achieve organizational goals. Technically, the business or organization itself 
can be seen as one enormous process. For exampl
e, a law firm that handles criminal defense cases 
operates via a huge, complex process. Defendants and their cases enter the process. The output of the 
process is the result of the case: a bargain with prosecutors, a win or loss in court, or dismissal of 
charges prior to court. 
 Within the huge process that sees the defendant through to his or her outcome, there are hundreds, 
possibly thousands, of smaller processes. There are processes within processes. A lawyer and team of 

paralegals might move through th
e process of negotiation; a legal secretary might go through the 
process of setting appointments. Holding depositions, making copies, sending letters, and filing legal 
documents are all examples of processes. At the most detailed level, even answering the 
phone or 
typing a letter can be considered processes.
 In Chapter 6, we briefly introduced the idea of scope and scope creep. To define and maintain proper 
scope, we said that a Six Sigma team had to identify the processes that were related to a process 
imp
rovement or project. In the legal firm example, a project to reduce the time it takes to set 
appointments would likely not include a process for filing a legal brief. To know that, however, you have 
to know that the legal brief process doesn™t share compon
ents with the appointment setting process. In 
this chapter, we™ll cover the components of processes and a format for mapping those components 

known as a SIPOC.
 Four Layers of the Process Definition
 As you continue with this chapter, you™ll see that process
es can be very complex. Our basic definition 
above is just that: Basic. Before we begin defining the components of a process, let™s peel back the 

layers of this concept known as ﬁa process.ﬂ
 The Steps 
 Whether physical, digital, or ideological, every proce
ss is a series of some number of steps. You can put 
those steps on paper in the form of instructions
Šoften called a standard operating procedure in a 
formal business training or policy document 
-- or a visual diagram known as a process map. A process

 map u
ses standard shapes and connections to create a map of a process that can be understood by 
most employees and any Six Sigma team member. 
 Processing Time
 Processes all take a certain amount
 of time, and processing time can change with a variety of factors. 
Process maps and documents can only record information such as the average time a process takes or 
measures of variation in the processing time. This information is often noted in such doc
uments because 
it provides valuable information to teams, but real
-time observation of a process almost always provides 
better information about processing time.
 A retail chain might create a process map for restocking a certain area. The process documenta
tion 
notes an average time of two hours to fully restock the shelves in the defined area. In an effort to obtain 
more data about the process, a Six Sigma team observes employees actually performing job functions in 

real time at various times of day for two
 weeks. Some notes that come from those observations include:
  Stocking in the evening takes only minutes.
  Stocking during the day is hampered by the movements of customers.
  Stocking work performed during peak shopping hours usually takes the longest.
 With 
just this information, you can probably see an easy way to reduce stocking time in this example: 
move stocking duties to non
-peak times when possible. Simply understanding the steps to stock the 
area is not enough to understand the process; you also have t
o gather data about process times.
 Interdependencies
 Almost any process in a business will be dependent upon one or more other processes. Remember, the 
business itself is a series of linked processes all working toward the same goal or goals. Sometimes, 
interdependencies are noted on processes maps
. Other times, interdependencies are resource
-related.
 For example, consider a very simple passenger train scenar
io. The train leaves station A with passengers, 

carrying them to station B. Before the train can leave, the engineer must be on board and prepared to 
operate the machine. Safety checks, clearance from the rail yard, the closing of all the doors: these are 
all processes that must be completed before the train leaves the station. The process of the train 
transporting passengers is dependent upon the completion of other processes. 
 When working with processes during a Six Sigma improvement project, teams must 
be aware of 

interdependencies. What does any process you are working on rely? What relies on your process? The 

first is important because you might need help from processes or people upstream from your process 
when making improvements. The second is import
ant because you have to know how your 
improvements will impact downstream processes and people

your process doesn™t do any good for the company or organization as a whole if it hinders the

 performance of a downstream
 process.
  Resources and Assignment
 Processes require resources. Like a motor vehicle requires fuel or electricity to run, a process requires 
resources such as power, people, cash, digital bandwidth, computer equipment, machinery, supplies, 

parts, and 
even skill. Since someone in an organization has to approve and pay for resources, project 
teams must understand the resources involved, the cost of those resources, and the owners of the 
processes and resources in question so they can make appropriate req
uests about needing additional 
resources.
 Major Process Components
 Processes are made up of components that include inputs, outputs, events, tasks (activities), and 
decisions. Inputs enter the process when a specific event occurs; tasks and decisions are performed 
upon or with the inputs. At the end of the process, an out
put is generated. Most of the time, the idea of 
process components is introduced with a simple factory
-based illustration: 
raw goods of some type 
enter the factory, work is performed, and finished goods leave the factory. For example, if a factory 
makes ha
rd candy, things such as sugar, water, plastic, and electrical power enter the factory. 
Equipment and employees take the inputs and work with them. The end result is a wrapped piece of 

candy ready for the store.
 The figure below illustrates the idea of pro
cess components using a pizza shop example. An event 
Œ the 
ordering of a certain pizza 
Œ begins the process. You can see all of the components in the diagram, and 
we™ll talk about each component in detail in the section that follows.

  Inputs
 Input refers to anything that enters a process or is required to enter a process to drive the creation of an 
output. In the pizza example above, the inputs are all the ingredients needed to make the pizza. 
You 
might also consider factors such as oven temperature, type of oven, and the cook™s skill level to be 
inputs in the process. 
 Understanding all inputs to a process is important in Six Sigma because inputs are often causal 
Œ or 
related to causal 
Œ factor
s regarding a process. Inputs or the results of those inputs can cause errors or

 defects in the process. The cookies burn when the oven is too hot. The computers made in a factory 
don™t function when the circuit boards are bad. A lawyer doesn™t win his cas
e if his or her information is 
wrong. The oven temperature, the circuit boards, and the lawyer™s information: these are all inputs into 
processes that are also causing problems within the processes.
 Other reasons for defining inputs when working with a pro
cess include:
  Understanding the resources required for a process to run
  Identifying extraneous inputs that aren™t required 
  Understanding costs for the process
  Understanding how the process relates to processes that come before it
 Remember, in a business, 
processes are linked together to accomplish a final goal or goals. The inputs 
entering process B might be the outputs leaving process A.
 Outputs
 The output of a process is the service or product that is used by the customer of the process. In the pizza 
example, the output is the cheese pizza the customer is going to eat. In the candy factory example, the 
output is the hard candy that will be sold by the retail store.
 The process customer is not always the traditional end customer who purchases a product or 
service. 
Customers can be internal or external. An example of a process serving an internal customer might be 
seen in a business office that employees a receptionist to answer phone calls. If the receptionist takes 
messages or transfers phone calls, he or 
she is serving both the person on the phone 
and the person 
who is receiving the call or message.
 In some cases, the customer of a process is not even a person. Many processes feed other processes. In 

a pharmacy, the process of entering data about a prescri
ption feeds the process that bills an insurance 
company for the medication.
 From a Six Sigma perspective, an output is almost always of more value to the ultimate process than the 

input is. The process itself involves adding value of some kind to the input
s. A bakery puts raw bread 
dough through the oven to add value to it: the result is an edible and tasty product that a consumer is 
more likely to purchase or to pay more for.
 Events
 Events are specific, predefined criteria or actions that cause a process t
o begin working. A process that 
performs well responds to an event just like a light bulb responds to the action of a switch being pulled. 
Six Sigma teams must determine what events trigger a process because it helps them understand why a 
process is being 
performed and whether the process is being run when it isn™t needed.
 Consider an example about compliance audits in a financial sector company. Perhaps a company created 

a specific audit process that initiates when red flags on accounts are raised; the aud
it process is 
comprehensive and usually takes an average of 80 labor hours. You can imagine that it is an expensive 

process to run. In investigating, a Six Sigma team identifies the event associated with the process: 

any
time a
 discrepancy in an account is 
noted by a clerk, the compliance process is triggered.

 The team investigates and realizes that this is true even when the discrepancy was minor 
Œ a few dollars 
or less 
Œ or the clerk was able to reconcile the discrepancy later in the day. The team might s
uggest that 
the relationship between the process and the event is a problem. The process is running at times when 
it might not be valuable for it to do so.
 Tasks
 Tasks, or activities, are
 the heart of a process. Just as the heart pu
mps blood through your body, the 
tasks within a process pump the inputs through, turning them into the outputs. Tasks are the physical, 
automated, or computerized actions within a process. Examples of tasks include:
  A machine joining two metal parts with a
 weld
  A person entering data into a software program
  A computer processing data to create a report
  An email being written 
  A piece of computerized work being routed within a workflow system
  A chef chopping ingredients for a recipe
 Decisions
 Decisions are c
losely related to tasks and can be tasks themselves. A chef preparing ingredients for a 
soup dish has to chop those ingredients, but he also has to decide how much of each ingredient he 
needs. His decision will likely be guided by the recipe and the number
 of people he has to feed. 
 Decisions within a process are typically governed by a set of rules. Sometimes those rules are formally 
documented; other times, decisions are made via informal rules along with staff knowledge and 
experience. Processes that are
 governed by informal rules can have problems of consistency; even when 
all staff are experienced, they could have individual variations on performing a task. And, as we 
discussed in Unit 1, variation can lead to more opportunities for defects and a reduct
ion in quality.
 Using the task examples above, here are examples of decisions in a process:
  A person entering data into a software program makes a decision to select a certain drop down 
category because of training or rules provided by the software
  A compu
ter processes a report; the result of that report is a number above a set threshold, so 
the computer sends the report to a person
  When writing an email, a person chooses to include certain specific information, such as an 
order number or customer number, b
ecause it is protocol to do so when sending this type of 
email
 All Components Are Related
 You™re probably noticing that processes can be extremely complex, and the relationships between all 

the components are equally complex. Inputs can be outputs from pre
vious processes; outputs can be 
inputs in the next process. A decision might result in an event that starts a new process, but it can also 

be the factor that decides which task begins. As Six Sigma teams work with processes 
Œ observing them, 
diagramming th
em, and measuring them 
Œ the teams begin to understand the relationships of the 
components, and that helps them make decisions about possible improvements and changes.

 Process Owners
 As teams work to improve processes, they need to understand who the proc
ess owners are. Depending 
on the business organization, process owners can be the people with the power to approve changes. In 
some organization
s, the lowest
-level owner might not have veto or decision power about all changes, 
but he or she is held respons
ible for the performance of the process. 
 A process owner can be:
  A person in charge of a very specific process or function
  A team supervisor or department manager
  An executive
-level individual who is probably responsible for a number of processes in his o
r her division
 What does a process owner do?
 The responsibilities of a process owner are often defined by the infrastructure of a specific business, but 
commonly, a process owner will:
  Monitor how the process performs, usually using one or more metrics or 
regularly reported data 
elements.
  Understand how the process fits into the overall business, why the output of the process is 

critical to business goals, and what inputs feed the process.
  Ensures the process is documented via standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) and that process 
documentation is kept current and accurate.
  Ensures operators within the process have the resources and training they need to complete 
their jobs.
 In a Six Sigma environment, process owners might also ensure a control plan is in pla
ce and regularly 
review the process for possible improvement opportunities.
 Data
 Finally, all processes generate some form of data. Even if data isn™t yet being captured, information is 

inherent in any process. A computer program that automatically routes 
work in a workflow might 
generate data such as the number of items in work queues, how many items were worked that day, the 
time items have been waiting in queues, how many items were transferred, and where those items 
were transferred to. A process for fi
lling bottles with liquid might generate data such as how much liquid 

is placed in each bottle, how many bottles per hour are filled, and perhaps variation between bottles.
 Data is extremely valuable to Six Sigma teams because it™s often how they define wh
ether a process is in 
control and successful. 
 Defining Process Components: The SIPOC
 The SIPOC diagram is often an impo
rtant part of
 the
 define stage of a Six Sigma project
. But you can use 
the SIPOC diagram anytime you want to learn more about a process or understand how a process in a 
business environment is linked to other processes.
 Page |

 SIPOC stands for Suppliers
, Inputs, Process, 
Outputs
, and Customer.  For the purposes of a SIPOC, inputs 
and outputs follow the same guidelines described previously in this chapter. Suppliers are the people, 
processes, and organizations that supply inputs to your process. Cus
tomers are the people, processes, 
and organizations that make use of the outputs of your process. The process itself is the series of steps 
that take the inputs and make them outputs. 
 Benefits of a SIPOC Diagram
 The SIPOC diagram is one of the most oft
en used tools for 
understanding process components and process relevance 

because it is so effective and simple. Teams can create 
SIPOC diagrams 
in a single brainstorming session, though 
effective diagramming usually requires the presence of a 
process owner and one or more SMEs who are familiar with 

the process on a daily level. 
 SIPOC diagrams are also infinitely scalable. Teams can 
diagram proces
ses at a very minute level, but they can also 
use SIPOC to diagram an entire business. We™ll walk 
through creating a SIPOC diagram and then provide some 
examples of SIPOCs at various levels to illustrate scalability.
 Creating a SIPOC Diagram
 You can create
 a SIPOC diagram as an individual exercise or within a team environment. SIPOCs can be 
created using a computer and software 
tool 
such as Word or Excel, but you can also draw them 
freehand on a whiteboard or piece of paper. Freehand diagramming is a valuab
le brainstorming tool 
because teams can quickly edit the rough draft of the diagram as they discuss a process. 
Keep
 this in 
mind 
:many of the diagrams presented in thi
s book look clean because they have already been typed 
and edited. As you diagram your own processes, they can tend to look messy at first with edits, arrows, 

scratch outs, and inserts. ﬁEditingﬂ or putting rules on the brainstorming process can limit the 
ideas and 

information that flow during the process. You can always create a clean copy of the diagram for 
presentation purposes when you are 
finished 
brainstorming. 
 Step 1: Create Swim
 Lanes
 A SIPOC diagram is based on swim lanes. Swim lanes let you show 
how cross
-functional activities and 
resources relate to your process. A SIPOC
 diagram
 gets five lanes
: one each for Suppliers, Inputs, 
Process, Outputs, and Customers. You™ll end up with something that looks like the figure below.
 Suppliers
 Inputs
 Process
 Outputs
 Customers
         SME
: Subject Matter Expert
 An SME is someone who is closely 
associated with or familiar with a 
process or work function. Six Sigma 
teams invite SMEs to participate in 

discussion, process mapping sessions, 

or problem and solution 
brainstorming, because SMEs have 
valuable insight that might not be 
provided by high
-level process 
owners or a review of the data.

   Step 2: Set Boundaries and Name Your Process
 Before beginning a SIPOC session, set a definition for where your process or responsibility begins and 
ends. If you don™t understand the scope of your process, then your SIPOC sessi
on can get out of hand or 
produce a diagram that isn™t useful for your project. 
 Naming your process helps the team identify more readily with a specific aspect of the business. For 

example, a team working to improve processes within a medical office might
 look at a process named 
ﬁGathering New Patient Information.ﬂ By naming the process, the team has put some scope limitations 
in place: the team will talk about things related to gathering information from patients. The scope is 
further limited to the proce
ss by which staff gathers information from 
new
 patients.
 As you work through the SIPOC diagramming exercise, you can point back to the name and the scope 
you™ve defined to keep the team on task with the discussion. 
 Step 3: Complete Swim Lanes
 You can comp
lete SIPOC swim lanes in any order, but best practices usually have teams enter data in the 
following order:
  Process
  Outputs
  Customer
  Inputs
  Suppliers
 Realistically, teams will think of things as they work through the process, so you™ll be returning to 
swim 
lanes repeatedly to move information around and add new information.
 A SIPOC isn™t usually a low
-level or detailed map of the actual process, so keep teams high
-level when 
completing the process swim lane. You can simply enter the name of the process 
in that section
, or you 
can list some of the high level steps required for the process. Listing steps is a good exercise if teams 
aren™t sure about outputs and inputs 
Œ beginning to visualize the process usually helps ideas flow about 
how the process is co
nnected to other processes and resources in the company. 
 To keep the session from turning into a detailed process mapping activity, ask the team to describe the 
process in less than five to seven steps. Keep things simple by limiting process steps to shor
t verb
-noun 
combos such as ﬁEnter information,ﬂ ﬁCollect money,ﬂ or ﬁPlace labels.ﬂ
 Name Outputs and Customers
 Once you have a rudimentary process definition, begin with either inputs or outputs.  Ask the team 
ﬁWhat does this process make? What comes out of this process?ﬂ Those answers go into the outputs 

swim lane. 
 Next, ask the team ﬁWho or what uses the things 
that come from this process?ﬂ Place those answers in 
the customer swim lane. Remember that customers can be external or internal, and another process can 
be the customer in cases of automation.
 Page | 
79  © 201

 Name Inputs and Suppliers
 Ask the team ﬁWhat does the process 
need to perform? What raw goods or materials feed the 
process?ﬂ Record those answers in the inputs section.
 You can divide the idea of inputs into two types, if you like. First, you have the actual inputs 
Œ the goods 
and services that are transformed by th
e process to create the outputs. Second, you have 
enablers
 of 
the process. These aren™t technically inputs because they don™t enter the process and aren™t changed by 
the process; instead, they are required for the process to function. Machinery is an enabl
er. In a process 
that cuts metal parts from a steel sheet, the machine that does the cutting is an enabler. While it™s not 
required, separating enablers on your SIPOC helps you define the process and provides additional 

information for later in the project
. Once you have a list of inputs, ask the team
, ﬁWhere do the inputs come from? Who or what supplies 
the process with these things?ﬂ As with customers, suppliers can be external or internal. A vendor might 

provide the raw sugar that goes into the candy in 
a factory; the marketing department might provide 
the leads that the sales department uses to create orders. 
 Suppliers can also be other processes, particularly in an automated environment, and you can have a list 
of several suppliers for one input in a r
aw SIPOC diagram. For example, support tickets come into the 
Information Technology (IT) department. The supplier of the ticket could be both the end
-user 
submitting the ticket and the automated process that routes the ticket to the appropriate work queue.
 If 
you are documenting enablers, you might record the end
-user as the supplier and the automated 
process as the enabler.
 Step 4: Validate the Information
 Ensure that your understanding of the process at this high level is accurate by validating your diagr
am. If 

you™ve put together a comprehensive team that includes SMEs, the team can validate most of the 
information on its own. It™s always a good idea to get a second opinion on anything the team isn™t sure 

about, though. Invite other SMEs or the process ow
ner to review the diagram briefly with the team and 
provide feedback.
 Tips for a SIPOC Brainstorming Session
 One of the best ways to create an initial SIPOC 
diagram 
during a team session is on large pieces of paper 
or a whiteboard. Create swim lanes by dra
wing them on the whiteboard or hanging a piece of paper for 
each swim lane on the wall. Provide the team with sticky notes and markers; write on sticky notes 
instead of writing directly on the board or paper. This lets you move components around quickly as
 you 
work through the diagram.
 Sample SIPOC Diagrams
 Here are some sample SIPOC diagrams. The first diagram is at the highest level: the process is the 
business itself. The second diagram features an automated process. The third diagram illustrates a 

peopl
e-powered factory process and includes enablers.

 This diagram shows the SIPOC for a mid

-level, simplified SIPOC 
that shows how customers and vendors provide information and items; the 
printing company then turns 
those inputs into products such as printed business cards. The final product goes to individuals, 
businesses, and marketing professionals who placed the order.

  Most of the time, a Six Sigma team won™t deal with a business

team includes members from outside the division or company, such as vendors or consultants assisting 
with an 
improvement, then starting with a high
-level diagram can help those outside of the business 
understand the overall goals of the company.

Because this is a process within a chain of automated processes, almost all of the components are 
machines, processes, and things. Prior to labeling, a machine sorts bottles by size. That machine feeds 
the labeling station as needed. After the labeling is 
done, another station fills the bottles. 
 SIPOC with Enablers Noted
 The SIPOC diagram below illustrates how enablers might be recorded for your process. The process in 

question takes place in a factory that makes furniture; in this process, a person attach
es legs to a 
barstool on an assembly line. For the purposes of this illustration, leg attachment is the last step in the 
completion of the product, which means the product moves from the leg attachment station to packing 
and shipping.

   Without the conveyor machine, the people in involved in this process would have to move items 
manually. The conveyor isn™t 100 percent required for legs to be added to the stool, but it enables the 

process to move at a more efficient pace. A case could be 
made that the drill isn™t required either 
Œ screws can be installed manually 
Œ but it™s certainly what enables the process to move at a speed 
required for mass production. 
 With just this simple SIPOC diagram of a process, a Six Sigma team would already ha
ve some idea about 
where variation could be hiding, what drives efficiencies in the process, and how the process relates to 
the overall business.
 Create Your Own SIPOC Diagram
 Whether working in a team or on your own, choose a process you know about and pr
actice creating 
your own diagram. Pick a process associated with your business or a business example you have 

experience with. Use the templates on the next page to get you started.

 Chapter 8: Quality
  One of the most concise definitions of quality comes from the International Organization for 
Standardization, or ISO. ISO 9000 defines quality as the 
ﬁdegree to which a set of inherent 
characteristics fulfills requirements.ﬂ
7  The same document defines requirements as expectations or needs that are implied, obligatory, or 
stated, and the ISO notes that requirements can be generated by different interest
 points. A Six Sigma 
team should be interested in requirements generated by all interest points, but often focuses most on 
those generated by the customer. Various types of requirements might include:
  Customer expectations, which are typically stated or im
plied values. It™s implied that a customer 
wants the product he or she ordered. Expectations of delivery speed might be stated in the 
form of feedback in customer surveys.
  Compliance or regulatory rules, which are 
obligatory
. For example, banks must protec
t credit 
card information
Šthey are obligated by rules from government and the industry™s Payment 
Card Information Data Security Standards (PCI
-DSS). Similarly, healthcare organizations must 
protect the confidentiality and security of patient data; they are
 obligated to do so under the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
  Brand expectations, which come from in
-house leadership. Brand expectations are typically 
stated; while not obligatory in the sense of being backed by regulation, co
mpanies for which 
high
-quality, a specific voice, or other unique factor is a component of branding might treat 
brand expectations as obligatory. Coca
-Cola, for example, has a brand that is recognizable 
around the globe. While components of that brand, suc
h as the design of logos or soda cans, 
aren™t mandated by regulations and might not be required by customers, Coca
-Cola itself holds 
these components as important and puts resources and effort into them because it values its 
brand.
 In this chapter, we™ll t
ake a look specifically at quality factors critical to processes and process 
improvement as well as costs associated with quality in general.
 Critical to Quality Characteristics 
 Critical to quality characteristics, or CTQs, are the factors or parameters t
hat are the major drivers of 
quality within an organization or process. Usually, CTQs are key characteristics that can be measured; 

where the performance of said metric provides information about whether or not the customer is going 
to be satisfied. 
 CTQs 
are closely related to CTCs, or critical to customer characteristics, but they are not the same thing. 
Something can be critical to quality 
Œ even critical to how a customer ultimately feels about a service or 
product 
Œ without being critical to the custom
er directly. CTQs are internal concerns, but they drive 
CTCs.

                                                            Let™s look at some examples of CTQs and CTCs to understand the difference and the relationship 
between these two factors.
 A Pair of Pants
 When a customer purchases a pair of pants, 
he or she is
 usually concerned with how the pants fit and 
look. Are they comfortable, is the size correct, and does the clothing match the customer™s personal 
style?
 It™s hard to create a measurement for whether pants are comfortable, but a manufacturer can take 
custom
er feedback on various types of pants and learn that a certain fabric with a certain cut is most 
comfortable for the target audience. The manufacturer can also determine appropriate measurements 
for each size. During the manufacturing process, these critic
al-to-quality factors are applied: only fabric 
that meets the specifications identified is used. The fabric is then cut to specific measurements and 
sewn together in a specific manner 
Œ measurements and sewing methods are critical to quality.
 The average c
ustomer, however, doesn™t want to hear about the exact measurements of each fabric 
piece or the way the seams were sewn. They want to put on a pair of pants and experience a 
comfortable fit.
 Chocolate Bars
 A chocolate company conducts a survey to find out why sales of its newest product haven™t performed 

as expected. The feedback suggests that the chocolate is too sweet 
Œ the taste and the sweetness of the 
chocolate is a critical to customer characteristic. 
 The company might tweak its formula, reducing the amount of sugar that goes into the chocolate. The 
recipe 
Œ and the amount of sugar 
-- is a critical to quality factor in this case. But what if the customer 
feedback indicated that health
-conscious consume
rs simply didn™t want to buy a chocolate bar with so 
much sugar in it? Then the amount of sugar in the recipe becomes both a CTQ and a CTC. It is critical to 
the quality of the taste of the bar, but customers might also look at the nutritional information 
on the 
bar and make purchasing decisions based on the amount of sugar in the chocolate.
 Mobile App Development
 If a business 
wants
 to launch a mobile app for its customers, then an obvious customer
-centric need is 
that the app works on the customer™s phone
. The customer doesn™t care about the process the business 
needs to go through to launch the app on the platform in question, but the business must meet the 

criteria for Apple, Android, Windows, or other mobile operating systems. Those requirements become 
some of the CTQs for the mobile app development, even though certain requirements from the 
platforms might not appear to be at all related to statements from customers about desires or needs.
 Why Identify CTQs?
 In a process improvement environment, CTQs ar
e critical to narrowing work scope and understanding 
how to enact change. Consider the 80/20 rule discussed in Chapter 5. Often, CTQs are the factors, 

characteristics, or outputs that drive 80 percent of customer satisfaction. By improving these few critic
al 
factors, teams can substantially impact customer satisfaction and the performance of the overall 

process. Identifying CTQs lets teams create the most improvement possible with the time, money, and 

people resources available. 
 Page | 
87  © 201

 Outside of a project environment, understanding CTQs lets organizations stay on top of quality. By 
managing a few critical metrics, teams can ensure excellent output in a continuous fashion and identify 
potential areas for improvement before they become cu
stomer
-facing problems. 
 Using a CTQ Tree to Convert Customer Needs to Quality Metrics
 In Chapter 5, we introduced the concept of the Voice of the Customer, or VoC. Six Sigma teams usually 
start with some type of VoC data when they are defining a problem a
nd working on goals for a project. 
Either the team conducts surveys to hear from a statistically relevant group of customers during the first 

few phases of a project, or the team receives feedback from internal customers about a process. 
Sometimes, the VoC
 information a team begins with is something as simple as a champion or executive
-level individual making a statement about expectations for an internal process or project. When VoC 
data is limited in such a fashion, teams might have to work harder to vali
date assumptions with data 

before moving on to CTQ analysis.
 To gain a better understanding of how to measure the quality of a process, teams must convert VoC 

statements to CTQs. One of the best ways to do this is through a diagramming process known as a C
TQ 
tree.
 A CTQ tree begins with specific and critical customer needs, breaks 
that need
 down into drivers, and 
uses the drivers to create requirements. Specific requirements are easier to convert to measurable 
quality components. While each CTQ tree is uniq
ue, they begin with a common form. The common 
structure of a CTQ tree is shown below.
   When creating a CTQ tree, you don™t have to follow an equal pattern for drivers and requirements. 
Some customer needs will have more drivers than others; some drivers 
will have more requirements.  

You might also have multiple CTQ trees 
Œ you™ll want to create one for every need you identify that is 
critical to a customer.

  Identify Critical
-to-Customer Needs
 Begin the CTQ tree process by creating a list of needs that ar
e critical to the customer. A bank working 
on processes dealing with online checking access might identify accessibility, user
-friendly interfaces, 
and security of information as the major critical
-to-customer needs, for example. Define needs in broad 
term
s to help catch all drivers and requirements later in the diagramming process. 
 The best way to define needs is to directly ask customers for feedback, but time and resources don™t 
always allow for surveys. Six Sigma teams might be able to take advantage o
f data collected via recent 
surveys or feedback forms, which is the next
-best thing. In the absence of customer feedback, 
brainstorm critical needs with a group of employees who has knowledge of and experience with the 

customer. Subject matter experts from
 sales, customer service, and complaint departments can often 
provide viable information when the customer is the end
-user. You can also begin a CTQ tree with the 
outputs of your SIPOC diagram; depending on how you structured the outputs on a SIPOC, you mi
ght 
need to define critical quality factors for the output as a starting point for your CTQ tree diagram.
 Identify Drivers of Quality
 Once you have a list of critical needs, work with one need at a time to create a tree similar to the 

diagram above. Identi
fy quality drivers that must be present or met for the customer need to be 

fulfilled. For example, customers of an HVAC service company might require excellent service. Drivers 
for that need might include friendly service technicians, helpful and knowledge
able employees, and a 
timely response to service calls.
 Drivers are the transition point between customer needs and requirements; you don™t necessarily have 
to be able to measure drivers, but you want them to be a bit more detailed than the broad customer 
needs you already identified and you want to be flowing in the direction of measureable factors when 
possible. 
 List Requirements for Each Driver
 Requirements are the most detailed breakdown regarding critical to quality characteristics. These are 
the thin
gs that you 
can measure that lead you to understand whether drivers are performing 
appropriately so customer needs are met. 
 For example, let™s look at our HVAC example in a CTQ tree format.

   You can see in the above CTQ tree that drivers have been conve
rted to requirements 
Œ and each of 
those requirements can be measured with numbers. In some cases, driver
-to-requirement conversions 
equate to a hard number. The chocolate bar example at the beginning of this chapter features such a 
scenario: if the compan
y deems that the recipe with a quarter cup of sugar is the correct recipe, then 
the process metric for quality is exactly a quarter cup of sugar.
 In other examples, companies might provide leeway for exceptions or the understanding that a process 

is not 
going to hit an exact number every single time. For example, an HVAC team cannot possibly arrive 

at a customer™s home exactly 24 hours after a phone call is made 
Œ and if the service technicians can 
arrive earlier than 24 hours, most people would want them
 to. That means the company has to create a 
definition for the requirement: how many hours is it before a customer considers a technician untimely? 

In the case of our example company, it™s 48 hours. The requirement in another situation might be 24 

hours.
 Because teams will use the requirements from the CTQ trees to develop process measurements and 
metrics for success, it is extremely important that each requirement is vetted before teams incorporate 
it into the project or process. Requirements should be com
pared to VoC data, to existing measurements, 
and to experience and knowledge from subject matter experts and leaders. The team should ask 
themselves and others ﬁIf these requirements are met, will the customer be satisfied?ﬂ If the answer is 
ever no, then 
the requirements need work. The team might also consider asking ﬁAre these 
requirements possible in the real world.ﬂ If the answer is no, then either the process or the 
requirements needs work.

 The CoQ and the CoPQ
  Six Sigma teams must always be aware th
at quality comes at a cost. When talking about quality costs, 
many organizations consider what is known as the cost of poor quality, or CoPQ. The cost of poor quality 
is defined as the costs or expenses associated with defects created by a process. Quality
 actually has a 
broader cost 
Œ avoiding poor quality comes at an expense as well. The cost of quality, or CoQ, covers the 
expenses associated with maintaining good quality throughout an organization or process. Sometimes, 

this is referred to as the cost of
 good quality. In this section, we™ll talk about both types of cost 
measurements, how they relate to Six Sigma in general, and how they relate to Six Sigma teams and 
projects.
 The Cost of Poor Quality
 In some ways, the cost of poor quality is easier to mea
sure than the cost associated with overall quality. 
CoPQ is usually broken into two major categories: costs associated with external failures and costs 
associated with internal failures.  External and internal failures are often referred to as the costs of
 nonconformity 
Œ they are the expenses that occur when outputs do not conform to critical to quality 
requirements.
 External Failures
 External failures usually occur after products or services have been delivered, which means they are 
directly associated wi
th customer dissatisfaction. External failures might include revenue losses 
associated with a reduction in sales because of the quality of products, services, systems, or 
information. Other types of external losses include expenses associated with repairs,
 returns, or rework 
associated with a customer complaint; expenses associated with warranties; or loss of revenue or sales 
because of customer ill will or bad word
-of
-mouth. 
 Internal Failures
 Internal failures occur when products, services, or processes d
on™t conform to the requirements set by 
the company, and the product or service is provided to the customer in an unsatisfactory fashion. 
Internal failures are usually handled by scrapping the work, redoing the work, or repairing the work. 
Obviously, such 
rework results in added material and labor costs, but it also results in losses associated 

with delays, shortages of parts or inventory, and lack of flexibility or the ability to adapt. For example, if 
a process has such poor quality that 50 percent of the
 items produced by it require rework, then the 
process might be producing 40 percent less on a daily basis than it could be. That means the process can 
serve 
fewer 
customers, generate less output, and contribute less overall to the company™s profit.
 Calcul
ating the Cost of Poor Quality
 Understanding the cost of poor quality is critical to Six Sigma organizations because it lets leaders 
understand how financial needs are related to the need for quality improvements. The higher the cost of 
poor quality, the m
ore likely an organization 
will
 work toward improvement. 
 At a project or process level, the cost of poor quality might help determine budgets for improvement. If 
poor quality within the process is costing an organization $5,000 a month, a project that cos
ts $20,000 
but saves $3,000 a month in quality would pay for itself in just seven months. On the other end, a

 project that costs $100,000 when the costs of poor quality are only $1,000 a month is less likely to make 
sense.
 The equation for CoPQ is:
 CoPQ = 
External Failure Costs + Internal Failure Costs 
 While the equation seems simple, identifying all of the costs associated with poor quality can be 
difficult. Most experts use the metaphor of an iceberg to explain the hidden costs of poor quality. On 
the su
rface, you see the very small tip of the iceberg
Šthe obvious costs of poor quality. These might be 
things such as scrap, reprocessing, warranty claims, customer returns, and extra shipping. 
 Beneath the surface, however, an iceberg is always much bigger. T
he same 
is usually true of
 the cost of 
poor quality, and hidden costs might include:
  Loss of customer loyalty
  Loss of morale
  Loss of employees if morale remains low for extended periods
  Conflicts associated with scheduling or rescheduling 
  Higher risks of 
compliance issues, including fines
  Higher administrative costs
  Unpredictable revenue, sales, or production
 Calculating the cost of poor quality is extremely difficult on an enterprise
-wide level and still moderately 
difficult on a process level. A method 
for listing all possible costs and formulizing them to dollar amounts 
doesn™t exist. It™s a good idea for organizations to develop a streamlined method that is used throughout 
the enterprise when calculating CoPQ. At the very least, Six Sigma experts in th
e organization might 
consider defining a specific way of listing costs of poor quality company
-wide so that various process 
teams are using similar measures when they report to leadership.
 The Cost of Quality
 The cost of quality, or CoQ, includes the cost 
of poor quality 
and the cost of good quality. In addition to 
internal and external failure costs, CoQ includes prevention and appraisal costs. Prevention and 

appraisal costs are often referred to as the costs of conformity 
Œ they are the expenses related t
o 
ensuring outputs conform to critical to quality requirements. 
 Prevention Costs
 The costs of prevention are the expenses that are related to any activity meant to stop an error or 
defect from occurring. Error
-proofing, which is covered in detail in later
 chapters on controlling 
processes, results in prevention costs. For example, if a company produces baked goods, at some point 
in the process people or machines must measure ingredients to add to dough batches. One way to 
error
-proof such a process is to p
rovide specialized machinery that will only allow a specific amount of 
each ingredient to be introduced to a batch. Such a machine would likely be quite expensive; it would 
also have to be managed by a qualified operator and maintained by appropriate repai
r and cleaning 
staff. All of that activity would generate costs which might be considered preventative in nature.

 Other types of prevention costs include expenses related to quality planning, reviews, or education and 
training focused on quality. Quality r
eview and evaluation processes also create prevention costs, 
whether those reviews are related to suppliers, products, processes, or people. Customer surveys, the 
creation of technical manuals, work to create and manage requirements and specifications, and
 the 
management of job descriptions can all lead to prevention costs. Even housekeeping costs might be 
considered preventative costs, especially if a clean work environment is required to reduce flaws or 
errors in product manufacturing.
 Appraisal Costs
 App
raisal costs are those associated with any activity meant to ensure high levels of quality across a 
process or organization. If a manufacturing plant hires a quality control specialist, and that person™s job 
is to review parts that come down the manufactur
ing line and either return the work for correction or 

report the level of quality as a metric, then the salary of that person and any expenses related to his or 
her employment are appraisal costs. In some cases, those expenses might also be considered prev
ention 
costs, 
but they would not be counted twice when calculating CoQ.
 Other types of appraisal costs might include expenses related to quality audits on products, services, or 
processes, the cost of calibration and measurement equipment or software, and 
the costs of field tests. 
Prototype inspections, consulting expenses, financial reporting and auditing, security checks, safety 
checks, supplier certifications, employee surveys, and customer feedback are all further examples of 

areas where appraisal costs
 might exist.
 Calculating the Cost of Quality
 The equation for CoQ is:
 CoQ = CoPQ + Prevention Costs + Appraisal Costs
 The same challenges inherent in calculating CoPQ also exist when calculating CoQ. The same iceberg 
analogy is relevant, and prevention an
d appraisal activities often have hidden costs such as unnecessary 
overtime, paperwork, or system expenses. 
  The Cost of Quality and Six Sigma
 Traditional wisdom might say that if the cost of poor quality goes down, the cost of good quality is likely 
to g
o up. You have to spend money on quality to have good quality, in other words. While historically 
that might be true for many organizations, it is not the case in a Six Sigma company. Because Six Sigma 
works to create quality that is inherent in the proces
s Œ meaning things are done right the first time and 
defects are reduced 
Œ the costs of quality often go down while quality itself goes up.
 In Chapter 1, we showed that a process with a higher sigma level (and thus, higher quality) has 
fewer 

defects. Defec
ts decrease in an exponential manner as sigma level rises. Because there are 
fewer 
defects, the costs of poor quality are exponentially reduced as well. But time and again, Six Sigma has 
also reduced the cost of overall quality. As the sigma level of proce
sses is increased via the application of 
Six Sigma tools and methodology, the cost of both prevention and appraisal goes down as well.

 One way of relating the cost of quality 
Œ and perhaps the most common way of doing so among 
corporations 
Œ is as a percen
t of sales. The cost of quality as a percent of sales typically aligns so closely 
with sigma values that you can predict the cost of quality based on a company™s or process™s sigma 
value. The average ranges for CoQ in relation to sigma values are shown in 
the table below. As you can 
see, as companies improve their sigma levels, they experience a substantial savings in the cost of 
quality.
  Sigma level
 Cost of Quality as a Percent of Sales
 2 Above 40%
 3 25 to 40 %
 4 15 to 25%
 5 5 to 15%
 6 Less than 1%
       
 Managing Cost of Quality
 Six Sigma is one of the best methodologies for managing the cost of quality because it works to build 
quality into every process. When approaching an organization or process that has a high cost of quality, 
teams and 
leadership can apply a triage
-based method to reduce those costs. While no organization can 
remove quality costs 100 percent, the goal should be zero costs of failure, either internal or external, 

and minimal preventative and appraisal costs.
 First, teams 
should concentrate on costs associated with failures. It™s often easier and less expensive to 
detect costs associated with nonconformance, and improvements that seek to correct causes for a few 
critical failures can have a big impact on overall quality and
 total cost. Instead of adding layers of quality 
programs over processes to ensure quality 
Œ which only adds prevention or appraisal activities and 
increases the cost of quality 
Œ Six Sigma improvement projects build preventative measures into 
processes th
emselves. In other words, efficient Six Sigma processes are self
-regulating. They have built 
in checks and balances that work to constantly reduce defects and rework.
 The benefit of building failure stop
-points into a process include:
 Page | 
94  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
  Earlier detection whe
n errors do occur, which keeps hidden costs down. When the error can™t 
make it to the next process or to the customer, you avoid many issues and costs associated with 
low morale, reduced customer loyalty, or product returns.
  Employees are able to support a
nd manage higher quality. When quality is something 
employees have ownership of, they are more likely to work hard to create the best possible 

output. In contrast, appraisal
-style quality programs can spark feelings of paranoia at being 
closely watched or 
create a relationship in employee minds between the idea of quality and the 
idea of reprisal or correction. Poor performance on a continuous basis does need to be 

addressed, but employees should not default to a negative mindset when they hear the word 

qua
lity.
  In-process quality assurance is actually more effective than post
-process or over
-process 
prevention and appraisal methods. Statistical process control and Six Sigma improvements 
can 
push a process to six sigma level. To ensure the same level of perf
ormance 
Œ 3.4 defects per 
million opportunities 
Œ quality assurance employees would need to review millions of parts and 
ensure only a very tiny few had defects. It™s simply not an economical option for most, if any, 

organization.
 After 
teams use 
the Six S
igma and Lean process management methods discussed throughout this book 
to reduce failure costs, teams can turn to prevention and appraisal costs. Often, in a process that is 

functioning at a high sigma level, prevention and appraisal activities are a form
 of muda. They can be 
expunged from the process without impacting the end product, quality, customer satisfaction, or 
employee morale. In some cases, removing prevention or appraisal from processes actually creates a 
positive impact on quality, production,
 and customer and employee satisfaction. 
 Identifying Prevention and Appraisal Activities
 The first step to removing quality
-related muda is identifying it. Process maps, spaghetti diagrams, and 
value stream maps are valuable tools for uncovering activitie
s that don™t need to be included in a 
process. All of these tools are covered in depth in Unit 9.
 Whether you™re mapping a process or simply discussing various components with process owners or a 

Six Sigma team, asking questions about value and necessity c
an also help identify muda of prevention 
and appraisal. If you think an activity related to a process might be an unnecessary form of prevention 
or appraisal, ask:
  Does the activity itself add any value to the output? 
  Does the activity substantially reduc
e the time it takes for the process to produce an output?
  Does the activity substantially increase the cost of the process?
  If the activity is designed to prevent defects within the process, can the activity be made more 

efficient?
  If the activity is desig
ned to prevent defects, can the activity be made less expensive? 
  If an activity is designed to capture quality data about the process for reporting purposes, are 

those reports necessary? 
  If quality reports are necessary
Œ either because of obligatory requ
irements such as compliance 
or because the reports provide value in another process 
Œ can the reports be automated to 
reduce associated expense?

 The answers to these questions help teams identify areas where muda can be removed or where 
quality
-related pro
cesses can be improved.
  Quality is Critical to Success 
 When Six Sigma teams are expunging quality
-related costs and unnecessary activities from processes, it 
is critical that they don™t actually remove quality. While it™s true that traditional quality pr
ograms and 

costs don™t have to be present to ensure a reduction in defects and an improvement in customer 

satisfaction, it™s equally true that you have to replace those programs with some other form of control. 
By the end of this book, you will have learne
d about a number of tools, from statistical process control 
to poka 
yokes, which
 you can use to create quality within a process.
 It™s also worth noting that a single Six Sigma team 
Œ or even an entire department devoted to Six Sigma 
Œ can™t 
reduce the costs of quality in an organization on their own. Corporate leadership must buy into the 
belief that quality is better when controls are incorporated within the process, and they have to be 
willing to communicate this fact via training and examp
le. Some companies choose instead to use Six 
Sigma to improve processes while maintaining the expense of traditional quality, compliance, and audit 
departments. For some industries, such as healthcare or finance, audits and other appraisal and 
prevention c
osts might be mandated by laws and regulations. Outside of that mandate, it™s almost 
always best to remove any quality activity that doesn™t provide additional value.

 Chapter 9: Selecting the Right Projects
  Teams can bring abundant knowledge of Six 
Sigma to the table, but if organizations don™t choose the 
right projects, improvements won™t drive effective changes for the benefit of the bottom line and/or 
customer satisfaction. Since Six Sigma works best when it is implemented as a company
-wide cultur
e, 
project selection should work as an enterprise
-wide function. This chapter covers a number of tools and 
methods for brainstorming and selecting projects that are most likely to bring significant improvement 

to processes and serve overall business goals.
 Juggling the Right 
Amount 
of Projects
 A critical part of Six Sigma success for organizations is knowing when teams reach maximum project 
load. Even when organizations hire employees dedicated to process improvement, they can only sustain 

a certain number 
of improvement projects without substantially reducing the positive outcomes of 
those projects. While project work, including data gathering and analysis, might be handled by 
employees committed 100 percent to improvement projects, teams usually have to en
gage with and 
pull resources from regular staff members. An organization that juggles too many projects puts daily 
output at risk. 
In seeking to improve processes, a company that selects too many projects at one time 
could actually negatively impact qualit
y.
 No formula exists for how many Six Sigma projects a company should run at a given time, but a few well
-
designed projects are more likely to make greater impact than many poorly designed, overlapping, or 

unfunded projects. Organizations should only launc
h projects they can:
  Fund.
 Six Sigma projects take monetary resources, which means organizations must prioritize 
based on financial criteria.
  Support with people resources.
 Six Sigma projects require work from employees at all levels. 
Companies shouldn™t l
aunch three projects at one time that draw heavily on IT resources or 
attempt multiple, simultaneous projects that need input from the Director of Compliance on a 

regular basis. Relying too heavily on resources for multiple projects can burn out employees,
 decrease morale, impact quality, and impede work that is necessary to keep the business 

running from day to day.
  Manage.
 Project teams require leadership; Six Sigma teams are usually run by Black Belts, 
sometimes along with certified Project Managers. Sin
ce Black Belts are supported by Green 
Belts who handle much of the data collection and analysis work, a single Black Belt can usually 

manage more than one project at a time if needed. This is especially true for experienced Black 

Belts who are not responsi
ble for any type of daily operation. Even so, organizations with 
limited Six Sigma experts on staff can™t launch dozens of projects without putting a strain on 
those resources.
 Enterprise
-Level Selection Process
 When companies are working to apply Six Sigm
a culture to the entire enterprise, executive leaders and 
other decision makers should work directly with Six Sigma experts to identify improvement 
opportunities and launch projects. Doing so lets leadership align project selection with organizational

 goal
s, ensure projects are organized in a way that matches resources, and keep a bird™s eye view of 
improvement endeavors. Organizations can apply a five
-step procedure for identifying viable Six Sigma 
improvement projects.
 1. Data
-Based Review of Current Stat
e of the Organization 
 Organizations can begin with a high
-level look at internal and external sources of information about 
performance. Internal information might include complaints or issues raised by employees, existing 
performance metrics or reports, f
inancial reports, and quality reports. External sources include all of the 
Voice of the Customer tools we covered in Chapter 5. In reviewing internal and external information, 
organizations should ask:
  What types of things are customers or employees compla
ining about?
  Where is the organization falling short of benchmarks or competitor performance?
  What needs do customers have that the organization is not meeting?
  What needs might customers have in the near future that the organization is not yet able to 

mee
t?  What processes are outputting the most defects?
  What processes are known for the most rework?
  What are the slowest or most expensive processes in the organization?
  What are some obstacles keeping the organization from reaching its goals?
  2. Brainstorm 
and Describe Potential Projects
 Answers to the questions in step one become a brainstorming list for potential projects. What types of 
things are customers complaining about? Perhaps surveys and feedback forms show customers 

complaining about long shipment
 times, poor quality of products, or rude customer service. With just a 
single question, an organization has a list of possible projects:
  A project to reduce the time it takes for customers to receive orders
  A project to increase the quality of products
  A 
project to create better customer service
 Admittedly, the scope is enormous with these examples, so organizations would need to look for a bit 

more detail. Why do customers think the quality of products is low? In Chapter 6, we covered the 5 
Whys brainstor
ming method, and that method is relevant here. During the brainstorming process, 
organizations and teams should repeatedly ask ﬁWhy?ﬂ questions to get a more granular look at project 
possibilities. 
 For example, if a feedback form for a carpet installation
 company indicates that customers aren™t 
satisfied with the service they receive, the team might ask ﬁWhy are customers dissatisfied?ﬂ Further 
investigation into customer feedback might indicate that the customers are unhappy because carpet 
edges are comin
g up shortly after the carpet is installed. Why is this happening? The short answer is that 
something is wrong in the installation process. The organization might add ﬁImprove carpet installation 
processﬂ to a list of possible projects.
 Page |

 Creating a list of 
possible projects in this manner isn™t always a matter of a single brainstorming session. 
As issues are raised, more information might be required to list possible projects, but if you gather the 
right group of people for a few braining storming sessions, 
it™s likely someone already has that 
information or knows some basic answers. Remember, the point of this exercise is to call out possible 
areas for improvement, not validate assumptions or come up with solutions.
 Once teams have a large list of possible p
rojects, they should begin creating short descriptions that will 
become the basis of step three. The descriptions also let teams quickly identify things that are not 

actually problems or would not apply within an improvement project environment. Descriptio
ns should 
include answers to three questions:
  How is the issue painful to the customer, the employees, or the organization? In short, how 
does the issue impede someone from getting what they want or need?
  What is the goal that would be accomplished with an
 improvement?
  Why should an organization address this issue now?
 If this is starting to sound familiar, it™s because the answers to these questions create something similar 
to, though slightly less formal than, the problem statements discussed in Chapter 6
. Using the carpet 
installation example, for example, the description might be:
 Customers are not satisfied with carpet installation because edges are coming up within a few weeks of 
installation. The poor edges are creating safety and aesthetic issues and
 increasing expense and rework 
for teams who have to return to sites to address defects. The goal is to reduce the number of times 
carpet edges come up by 80 percent. The organization should address the issue because it is costing 
$20,000 per month in erro
rs.
 Some basic idea of what the team wants to do is provided, and leadership has a very real measurement 

of why the improvement is important. Even better, the measurement 
-- $20,000 in additional costs each 
month 
Œ can be compared to other project opportun
ities. 
 3. Apply Some Basic Criteria to Shorten the List
 Once a list of possible projects is created, teams can apply some very basic criteria to remove projects 

that are inappropriate, would not work with Six Sigma methodology, are not property scoped, or
 have 
little likely return on investment. This step usually begins during the second part of step two, when 
teams are creating short descriptions of possible projects.
 First, teams can remove items from the list where there is no real pain point. If a sign
ificant difference 
between desired state and current state doesn™t exist, then there™s nothing to improve. For example, if a 

single employee complaint about the efficiency of a piece of software made it onto the initial list, a 
company wouldn™t pursue impr
ovements further if it turned out no one else was having the issue.
 Second, teams can remove issues that have very obvious problems and/or solutions. Consider the carpet 
installation problem: 
if the issue of edges cropped up in the last month and someone o
n the team 
reviewing potential problems recently received an email about defects in edging materials from a carpet 
vendor, the solution might be obvious. Perhaps the vendor sent notification that the materials in a 

certain batch of carpet were faulty and p
rovided instructions for a solution. In this case, action is 
required on the part of the organization, but that action isn™t a Six Sigma project. We™ll talk more in 
Page |

 Chapter 11 
about the DMAIC process, but if a problem is already defin
ed and a solution provided, you 
don™t need to spend time going through the DMAIC phases.
  4. Create Unique Business Criteria 
 After removing project ideas that don™t fit Six Sigma methodology, teams should create and apply 
business criteria to further filt
er the list. 
Business criteria usually come
 in the form of expenses, 
monetary gains, impact on customer satisfaction, and urgency. Some questions teams might ask include:
  How will the improvement impact revenue
-facing measure
ments such as profit, orders, or 
income?
  What savings will the improvement create?
  How is the problem trending? Is it becoming a bigger and more urgent issue quickly, or can the 

organization operate with minimal impact without making an immediate or near
-future 
change?
  How much will the improvement cost?
  How many employees/employee hours will be required for the improvement?
  What resources are required for the improvement?
   5. Use Business Criteria to Prioritize Project Lists
 Using the business criteria, 
teams should prioritize projects and select projects from the top of the 
prioritized list for immediate work. One of the best ways to prioritize projects is to create a selection 
matrix with defined criteria and a numerical ranking system.
 For example, usi
ng the example questions in step four, we might create the following list of criteria:
  Potential savings 
  Potential cost
  Potential increase to revenue
  Ability to access resources needed 
 A matrix can be created using the criteria and a list of projects. Te
ams can then rate each project against 
each criteria using a numeric scale. In the example below, we applied a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being 
the most negative and 10 being the most positive.
 It™s important to note that in this example, the numbers aren™
t associated with real
-world numbers. For 
example, when rating savings, a higher number just means a more positive expectation. In this case, the 

positive expectation would be a high amount of savings. When rating costs, however, the higher number 

(and mor
e positive expectation) would relate to a project with a lower overall cost. 
   Savings
 Costs
 Revenue increase 
 Access to 
resources

 2 Project 
3 10 2 2 2 16 In the table above, you can see that Project 1 has low expected savings, but the team also estimates it 
will have a low overall cost, drive a high increase in revenue, and has easy access to resources. Project 3, 

on the other hand, has a high expected savi
ngs, but negative ratings in all other categories.  
 To rank projects, add up the scores for all categories and order the projects from highest to lowest by 
total score.
 The Project Viability Model
 Teams can choose to create their own criteria for a projec
t selection matrix, or they can use a 15
-point 
viability model as defined below. One benefit of the project viability model is that it provides some 
weighting, letting teams make some criteria more important than others. It also removes some of the 
objecti
ve nature of the selection matrix defined in the previous section.
 This model is based on 15 criteria, which are defined in the table below.
 Criteria
 Definition
 1. Sponsorship
 The project is likely to be sponsored at a high level. (For more 
information on
 project sponsorship, see the team building information 
in Chapter 10). Sponsorship increases the chance that teams will have 

access to the funds and resources required for a successful potential 
project.
 2. Corporate alignment
 The goals of the project ar
e aligned with the goals of the business. 
Working on potential projects that aren™t aligned with business goals 
can reduce business effectiveness.
 3. Data
 Data is available or can be accessed so the team can design project 
metrics. Without access to data,
 a Six Sigma methodology can™t be 
applied. If data is excessively time
-consuming or expensive to collect, 
then the potential project is usually not the best choice.
 4. Definition of defect
 There is a specific, well
-defined defect or problem. Without a wel
l-defined defect, potential projects run the risk of scope creep.
 5. Stability
 The potential process is stable and there are no expectations that the 
process is going to be overhauled, redesigned, or changed in the near 

future. There is usually no reason to spend time and money improving 
a process that will drastically change soon an
yway. 
 6. Customer 
 The planned goal of the potential project would create a substantial 
and positive impact on customer satisfaction or perception of quality.
 7. Benefits
 The potential project has a strong cost
-benefit ratio.
 8. Timeline
 The timeline f
or a potential project is relatively short. Timelines for 
Page | 
101

 most Six Sigma improvement projects are around 6 months, though 
some do run longer. Longer timelines decrease the chance that an 
improvement fits within the DMAIC methodology.
 9. Solution 
 The pote
ntial project purpose is to find a solution that is not already 
known or defined. As we previously stated, if a solution is obvious, you 

don™t need to run a project to find it.
 10. Implementation is likely
 A solution identified and verified by the potenti
al project is likely to be 
implemented. If, for any reason, change is very unlikely within a 

process, then going through Six Sigma improvement work is a waste of 
resources.
 11. Required investment
 The potential project requires a large investment of cash.
 Generally, 
the greater the cash or capital investment required, the less likely a 
project will be selected or a solution will be implemented due to cost
-benefit analysis. 
 12. Available Six Sigma 
Resources
 The Black and Green Belts required for the proje
ct are available.
 13. Inputs can be controlled
 For a Six Sigma process improvement project to be successful, at least 
some of the inputs must be within control of the team or organization. 
For example, a team can™t work to improve the quality of a part that is 

provided wholly by a vendor. 
 14. Redesig
n The process can be improved as is and doesn™t need a complete 
redesign.
 15. Process quality is 
improved/maintained
 The improvement doesn™t negatively impact the quality of service or 
products along the value chain.
    Based on the above criteria, teams
 create a matrix.

 3 Do project goals align with corporate 
goals?
 4 Is data available or accessible?

correspond with no, mostly no, possibly, mostly yes, and yes. The complete grid for our carpet 
installation problem is featured below.

  5  1     Once a matrix is completed for each project, teams must calculate and compare the score for potential 
projects. These calculations are 
completed via the following steps.
 1. Divide each weight by 3; a weight of 3 equals 1, but a weight of 5 equals 5/3, or 1.7
 2. Convert each of the 1s listed on your grid to a weighted value by multiplying it by the converted 
weight from step one. For examp
le, the weight for the first question on the grid above is 3. We divided 
3/3 to get 1. We would multiple 1 * 1 for the first row. The next row is weighted 4; 4/3 is 1.3. The

are calculated as:
  4.4 * 2 = 8.8
  4.7 * 3 = 14.1
  3.3 * 4 = 13.2
  4.4 * 5 = 22
 5. Add up the answers from the previous step. In this case, the total is 59.4.
 6. Divide the sum from step five
 by the sum of the weighted totals from step three. In this case, 59.4 / 
18.1 = 3.28
 7. The answer from step 6 is the score for your project.

 Once you score each potential project, you can determine if it is a viable project within a DMAIC 
methodology wit
h the following key:
 Score
 DMAIC Viability
 < 2.0
 Not viable for DMAIC
 2.0 to 3.0
 Possibility viable, but organizations should 
validate further
 Above 3.0
 A viable DMAIC project
   It should be noted that the 15
-point matrix described above can only be us
ed to determine if a project is 
viable within a DMAIC structure. A process might still need to be improved even though it doesn™t fit 
DMAIC methodology; in the case of a redesign, the DMADV structure might let Six Sigma teams 
approach the improvement. The 
differences between DMAIC and DMADV methodologies, and how to 
determine which method is best for a project, are covered more in
-depth in Chapter 11.
  Project Selection at a Process Level
 The goal of a Six Sigma team is not to define appropriate projects at an enterprise level. A department 
or team responsible for only a few processes might be seeking to make an improvement. In an 
organization where Six Sigma is important to business cultur
e, departmental leaders are likely familiar 
with some Six Sigma tools and might even be Green Belts or Black Belts themselves. While these leaders 
have daily responsibilities that are not Six Sigma related, they can bring Six Sigma thought processes to 
the
ir department. 
 Departmental leaders might want to identify potential opportunities to present to leadership. They 

might also want to identify areas where they and their teams can work toward improvement 
themselves. In some organizations, department leader
s can run smaller versions of projects with the 
guidance of on
-staff Six Sigma experts 
Œ especially when such projects would require little in the way of 
capital or resources.
 Departmental staff can use all of the tools in this chapter to identify possible
 projects. Often, though, 
they are close enough to the situation that they can identify possibilities for improvement without going 

through brainstorming stages. If data is already present, departmental staff might use Pareto charts to 
identify some areas 
where improvement would create results; they can then use the selections matrix to 
validate those assumptions and prioritize efforts.
  See for Yourself
 Consider a problem or need for improvement in your own company or one you faced in a past work 

experienc
e. Practice completing the project viability matrix using the template below.

 Chapter 10: Basic Six Sigma Team 
Management
  Six Sigma is typically managed on two levels within an 
organization. First, the culture of Six Sigma must 
be managed at an enterprise
-wide level, usually by a group or council of senior managers, such as 
executives, with the guidance of a Master Black Belt or Black Belt. Ultimately, this group sets the tone 
for Six Sigma within an organization, provides final approval on projects, and holds others accountable 
for metrics, performance, and success. While many of these individuals might also work as sponsors or 
champions on projects, as a group they don™t tend to
 get involved in the day
-to-day project details.
 Some roles of a high
-level Six Sigma leadership group include:
  Creating a rationale for the use of Six Sigma in the organization and supporting process 
improvement as a cultural goal.
  Setting clear objective
s for Six Sigma initiatives to ensure that project goals align with business 
goals. 
  Holding Six Sigma teams and the organization accountable for improvements and performance.
  Demanding and reviewing measurements of results
  Communicating wins and losses to
 the team in an honest manner.
  Rewarding teams and individuals for Six Sigma successes.
  Advocating for resources and funding for necessary improvement projects.
 Six Sigma must also be managed at the team level, which is the primary focus of this chapter. W
e™ll 
cover building a team, detail the various common roles within a Six Sigma team, and talk about 
managing a team with timelines and schedules, milestones, budgets, and a defined measure of success.
 Building a Six Sigma Team
 You can™t simply have a pre
-made team ready to begin work on every project that comes up. Six Sigma 
teams must be uniquely tailored to the goals and processes at hand. The same Six Sigma experts 
Œ Black 
Belt leaders, data analysts, or project managers 
Œ might work across multiple proj
ects, but individual 
subject matter experts and team members only bring high value to the team if they are familiar with the 
process or have some related education, knowledge, or skill to offer. Not all team members will serve 
consistently throughout the e
ntire life of a project, either. This is often why companies send existing 

employees for Six Sigma training rather than hire Six Sigma experts.
 Executive leadership groups working with Six Sigma leaders and experts usually put teams together. Any 

process i
mprovement team should have, at minimum:
  A Six Sigma leader
  A process owner
  An expert on the process
  Someone to manage budgeting and accounting
 Page |

 Some of those roles might be handled by the same person; the process owner might also be the process 
expert. Dep
ending on expectations of needs, the team might also need to include technical resources, 
such as a programmer or IT leader, as well as individuals from human resources, compliance, legal, or 
other ancillary departments.
 Three Types of Team Members
 When pu
tting teams together, organizations should remember that three basic team member types 
exist with relation to a Six Sigma project. First, there are the regular team members. These individuals 
participate in all activities of the team and attend all or almo
st all of the team
™s meetings. Regular team 
members include project leaders, process owners and experts, and identified subject matter experts 
who the team or executives feel would be critical components of their group. 
 Second, ad hoc team members provide
 expertise on an as
-needed basis. Usually, these are subject 
matter experts or employees who work directly with the process. You don™t want to take these 
employees from their job functions for every single team event, as that would negatively impact the 
state of current production. Instead, these employees are included in team meetings as needed when 
additional information or assistance is required.
 Finally, resource team members are only included when the project team leader feels they are needed 

in a meet
ing or team event to provide expert information, 
counsel
, or help in accessing resources. 
Resource team members are usually members of ancillary departments such as accounting, human 
resources, or compliance. Resource team members might also be managers or
 leaders in departments 
that are related to the process being improved. For example, if a team is seeking to improve a customer 
service department, they might need help with inputs from the marketing department; someone from 
the marketing department could 
be added as a resource team member.
 Tips for Selecting Team Members
 Most Six Sigma process improvement teams are relatively small: five regular team members is 
considered a good number on average. Adding too many regular team members can create 
communicati
on problems, make it difficult to manage brainstorming sessions, and cause burnout. When 
all of a company™s Six Sigma teams are large, there™s a good chance that team members are serving on 
multiple projects. While ad hoc or resource team members can serve
 several projects and handle their 
own work on a daily basis, regular team members should not be asked to serve on more than one team 
and handle daily workloads. In fact, organizational leaders might want to consider reducing work 
requirements for team mem
bers who are serving as full
-time members on a project.
 Other tips for selecting team members include:
  Choosing employees who are knowledgeable about the customer, product, or process related 
to the project.
  Choosing employees who have shown a willingness 
and ability to work toward improvement in 

a team environment.
  Selecting employees who have access to and an understanding of the data required to learn 
about and measure the process or problem.
  Picking employees who can provide at least five hours of work 
per week to the team.

  Matching the skills of employees to the projects at hand; if a project is likely to include all 
technical improvements, you would be less likely to add a team member who is skilled in 
marketing.
  Removing political obstacles through te
am selection; if a specific person in an organization is 
likely to be an obstacle to a team, sometimes putting that person on the team can increase the 
chance that they will buy into the process.
  Team Member Roles
 The team member roles described in this s
ection are based on Six Sigma process improvement best 
practices, but best practices also say that teams and team leaders should not be overly rigid. 
Experienced Six Sigma leaders and experts understand how to work within best practices while also 
creating
 unique team structures that are tailored to the project or process at hand.
 Sponsors and Champions
 We™ve briefly touched on sponsors and champions in previous chapters. In most Six Sigma 
environments, these are the senior
-level leaders who oversee project
s at the highest level. Even the 
Black Belt must report to the project sponsor or champion. The senior leader is usually responsible for 
the final result of a project, which means he or she usually wants regular reports about progress; 
sometimes, the spons
or or champion is the liaison between the team and the leadership council. As the 
senior leader, the champion or sponsor is also responsible for assisting the team with obtaining funds 
and resources to ensure project success. Some additional duties within 
this role include:
  Coaching the team, particularly at the project charter stage
. The sponsor often provides input 
into what is in scope on a project and who might be included on a team.
  Locating resourc
es for the team, including support from other departments, money, 
equipment, time, and labor hours.
  Handling matters of politics within a corporate structure so the team doesn™t have to.
  Working with other managers within the organization to help the team 
succeed in improving a 
process and transitioning improvements to a daily work environment.
 Business or Process Owners
 The business or process owner is usually someone who is directly responsible for the process in a 
leadership capacity. Usually, the proces
s owner is the person who is going to ﬁreceiveﬂ a solution 
implemented by a Six Sigma team once that solution is ready to be rolled out to all team members or 

used on a daily basis. Because of this, the process owner is usually included in the team because
 he or 
she must understand how and why any change is made
. The process owner must also be familiar with 
methods of control that are created by the Six Sigma team as he or she will become responsible for 
maintaining and monitoring those controls once the pr
ocess is transitioned from a team environment to 
day
-to-day production.
 A process owner usually also acts as a process expert on a Six Sigma team. The process owner has 

insight into the existing process, understands the needs of the customers and employees
 related to the 
process, and might already have access to data regarding the process. The process owner isn™t always

 the only process expert on a team, however; in some cases, the person who owns the process doesn™t 
have enough day
-to-day interaction with 
the process to be an expert.
 When leading or managing a Six Sigma team, Black Belts and others do have to be wary of process 

owners who are resistant to change or who believe they have all the answers. Someone who is set in his 

or her ways might not want t
o involve other team members or might believe certain changes are 
ﬁimpossibleﬂ because they are new. Some leaders who are also process owners might be afraid that a 
team member will outshine them or threaten their position, which could lead them to block t
eam 
members from participating on a team. These are some of the political and human resource problems 
Six Sigma leaders run into, and Black Belts and project leaders must work tactfully with champions, 
sponsors, and process managers to resolve such issues.
 Six Sigma Leaders
 Six Sigma projects are usually led by certified Black Belts, although some organizations do allow Green 
Belts to act as leaders on small initiatives with occasional feedback and guidance from Black Belts. In 
most organizations, the Black
 Belt holds primary responsibility for the regular work performed by a team 
and usually only works with one team or project at a time.
 Best case scenarios let organizations align Black Belts with projects in areas they are already familiar 

with. For exampl
e, a bank might have several Black Belts on staff. Each Black Belt might specialize in 
working with certain processes or departments; one might usually work with compliance and audit 
processes, another with accounting, a third with customer
-facing processe
s, and a fourth with online 
processes. Since Black Belt resources might be limited, this isn™t always possible. Most certified Black 
Belts can bring Six Sigma methods to process improvements even in areas they aren™t closely familiar 
with. In some cases, v
arious managers or other individuals are certified as Black Belts and can lead 
processes in addition to their regular responsibilities, although this can put an undue burden on 
employees and isn™t always the best solution.
 Black Belt project leaders often 
work to:
  Help create a rationale for a project.
  Provide input for the selection of project team members.
  Lead teams throughout all the phases of DMAIC, which are covered in depth in Unit 3.
  Educate and support team members as they learn about and use Six 
Sigma tools.
  Provide oversight through time management, decision making, and planning.
  Maintain schedules and timelines, sometimes in conjunction with a certified Project Manager.
  Provide expertise in the form of statistical analysis or guidance with analy
sis.
  Assist with project transition.
  Report to sponsor or champion on a regular basis.
  Provide documentation at the end of the project.
 In some organizations, Master Black Belts play an overall role in leading multiple Six Sigma projects. 
Master Black Belt
s act as coaches to multiple teams; Black Belts leading Six Sigma teams can work with 
Master Black Belts to solve especially difficult problems or seek help for complex statistical analysis. 
Master Black Belts provide continuing education to both Black and
 Green Belts, helping team members 
to constantly improve their grasp of Six Sigma methodologies.

 Project Managers
 Some organizations use traditional project management techniques alongside Six Sigma improvement 
methodologies. In these organizations, a proj
ect manager is usually assigned to a Six Sigma project. 
While structures vary by organization, the project manager does not usually lead the team. Instead, the 

PM offers leader support to the Black Belt by keeping up with documentation and timelines, helpi
ng 
keep meetings on track, and ensuring items are followed up on after meetings. At first, you might think 
that adding a PM to a team would cause problems for a Black Belt, but when the two roles work 
together, the Black Belt benefits. With a PM worrying a
bout timelines or whether the meeting is getting 
too far off track, a Six Sigma exert is free to concentrate on the brainstorming session or statistical 

analysis at hand.
 Timekeeper
 Not all Six Sigma teams use timekeepers, but they can help keep meetings o
n track, reduce the chance 
of scope creep, and increase overall productivity. The timekeeper can be any person on the team who is 
not regularly engaged in leading meetings
, brainstorming activities or recording team activities and 
notes. The timekeeper sho
uldn™t police time in a such a rigid fashion that the benefits of fluid discussion 
and brainstorming are lost, but he or she should gently steer teams toward following agenda schedules 

or provide the project leader with an indication that time is up for th
e topic at hand.
 To function properly, a timekeeper needs an agenda to follow.  It is usually the responsibility of the 
Black Belt or project manager to provide a detailed agenda for each meeting. The agenda should include 

clear indications regarding how l
ong each item is expected to take, though teams should always be 
aware that agendas might be changed during the meeting at the discretion of the project manager or 
project leader.
 Team leaders should pick a timekeeper who is organized and level
-headed. In 
the heat of discussions 
and arguments, it™s easy for any member of the team to lose track of time 
Œ and the timekeeper 
is a member of the team. In addition to regular duties as a team member, the timekeeper is expected to:
  Keep an eye on the agenda and the
 time
  Let team members know when the time for a certain agenda is almost up; teams might want to 
set up a five
-minute warning rule so they have a few minutes to wrap up a discussion
  Signal that the time is up for a certain discussion or item
 While project 
leaders can choose to ignore agendas, they should also back up the timekeeper™s ability to 
interrupt politely. Timekeepers can™t perform if they are being heckled by other team members for 

noting the time.
 Scribes or Minute
-Takers
 A lot of discussion occur
s in the midst of Six Sigma brainstorming and team sessions, and someone 
needs to record that information. Notes are important because they help team members review what 

was discussed, create lists of follow
-ups and actions from a discussion, and record ch
arts, graphs, and 
diagrams that were created during brainstorming processes. While everyone can take notes, the team 

leader should appoint one person as the official scribe for the team. Sometimes, that person is a 
certified project manager working in conj
unction with a Six Sigma team leader. Other times, it is a 
member of the team who is seen as detailed and organized.

 The Black Belt or other project leader should never be the scribe; it is too difficult to take notes while 
leading a discussion or exercise
. The Black Belt might make some notes during the discussion, but he or 
she is likely to miss important details while working directly with other team members.
 The scribe should create notes or minutes of the meeting in typed format and disseminate those n
otes 
to all team members as soon as possible following a meeting. Team members can review the notes and 
add any missing information if desired; often, organizations create portals or shared file systems so 
teams can keep notes and all other documents in an
 easy
-to-access location.
 One challenge in recording the discussions of a Six Sigma project meeting is in recording the diagrams 
and brainstorming that occurred. This is especially true if teams use whiteboards, paper, or sticky notes 
to create diagrams; t
he scribe is not always equipped with the skills or the software to recreate a 
computerized version of such documents. One tip for recording such information that is used by many 
modern Six Sigma teams is to take a picture of the diagrams with a smartphone
 or digital camera. The 
images can then be uploaded into the team™s shared workspace; if necessary, a Black Belt or Green Belt 
can convert the raw diagrams to a computerized version for the purpose of presenting information to 
leadership or other departmen
ts if desired.
 Team Members
 In the beginning of this chapter, we covered the three major types of team members: regular, ad hoc, 

and resource. Selecting members for each of these roles is up to the project leader, the sponsor or 
champion, and the overall o
rganizational leadership team. In addition to the project leader, process 
owner, and process expert, Six Sigma teams are usually comprised of one to three other regular team 
members. In addition to acting as timekeeper or scribe as directed by the team lea
der, team members 
also:
  Participate in brainstorming sessions, discussions, and other team activities.
  Collect data and perform analysis under the direction of the Black Belt. Often, team members 
performing these functions are Green Belts.
  Perform work 
between meetings as required by the project leader.
  Report the results of and progress on individual assignments to the team.
  Review work performed by other team members and the team as a whole, offering suggestions 
and feedback.
   Timelines, Scheduling, a
nd Milestones
 Scheduling and maintaining that schedule is an integral part of the Six Sigma project process. 

Organizational leaders need to understand how long a project will take, when results can be expected, 
and when team resources will be freed up for 
other endeavors. Without this information, leadership 
can™t plan for ongoing improvement and employees can feel trapped in a project that seems to stretch 
on forever. In this section, we™ll cover two methods for creating a project timeline or schedule and 
touch 

on the importance of milestones.

 Phase
-Based Timeline
 Six Sigma projects usually follow a specific series of phases; we™ve briefly introduced the concept of the 
DMAIC method
. DMAIC breaks a project u
p into five phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and 
Control. Experienced Six Sigma experts with some data and information about a project and process can 

usually provide a very basic and raw estimate of time by assigning a certain number of weeks to
 each 
phase. It™s also worth noting that most of the phases are likely to overlap
.  To create a raw timeline for a project, a Black Belt or other Six Sigma 
leader usually starts with an overall 
time requirement. He or she either estimates the total time required for an improvement or works with 
a deadline imposed by the leadership group. For example, the leadership group might say that an 

improvement needs to
 be completed within four months.
 Using a four month timeline and what information is already available about the process, problem, and 
resources, the Black Belt might create an estimated timeline for the DMAIC process that looks 
something like the figure 
below.
  The estimated timeline is for 16 weeks; the expert believes the Define phase will take 3 weeks and the 
Measure phase will take 5. The Measure phase overlaps with both the Define and Analyze phases, which 
is normal with Six Sigma projects.
 The bene
fit of this approach is that you can generate a timeline quickly. The disadvantages are that 
someone without experience of Six Sigma and a fair amount of knowledge of the process being 

improved can easily misjudge the time required for each phase and leade
rship might consider this a 
hard timeline, which can create unrealistic expectations. When presenting such a timeline, make sure 

everyone knows that it is a rough estimate and the time for each phase can change as you go through 
the process. 
 Critical Path
 Method
 The critical path method is a more detailed way of defining timelines for various elements of a project, 
but it does require more information and input from a project team. This means you probably won™t be 

able to provide a detailed timeline until 
the project is underway; a critical path diagram could be one of 

the activities the team undertakes as part of the Define phase.
 Creating a Critical Path Diagram
 A critical path diagram can be created for the entire project or for each phase of a project. 
As we go 
through the steps of creating a critical path diagram, we™ll use the Define phase of a project to reduce 
bad debt (uncollected invoices) in a medical billing environment as an example.

 1. Identify the critical needs or activities to complete the p
roject or phase of a project.
 To complete the define phase of our project to improve bad debt in a medical billing setting, the team 
needs to choose a team, charter the project, define the problem, and create a baseline metric
. 2. Put critical activities in order.
 The order with which the team should accomplish the tasks defined in step one is:
  Choose a team
  Charter the project and define the problem (these tasks can be done simultaneously
)  Create a baseline metric
 3. Assign a time to each task.
 A Six Sigma expert estimates it will take one week to choose a team, one week to create a charter, one 
day to create a problem statement, and two weeks to create a baseline metric.
 4. Create a 
diagram of the tasks, stacking simultaneous or parallel process and including time figures.
 The diagram is created from left to right. The items on the left must be done before the items to the 
right can be completed. When items can be done at the same tim
e, they are stacked.
   5. Draw a critical path through the diagram. 
 When steps are stacked, the critical path goes through the step with the longest time estimate. For 
example, the team might create a problem statement while they are working on a project
 charter; the 
project charter takes from Monday through Friday to complete. The problem statement is complete on 
Tuesday. However, the team is not done with all of the steps in that series until they are done with the 
project charter.

   6. Add up the lon
gest times from each section. 
 In this case, the team adds 1 week, 1 week, and 2 weeks to get to 4 weeks total for the Define phase.
 We™ve used a very simple example, but you can use the critical path method to estimate timelines for 
extremely complex proj
ects or processes.
 Milestone Meetings
 Once a timeline is established, set up milestone meetings and dates to help keep the team on track and 

notify the sponsor or champion of progress. In a DMAIC project, milestones are usually set at the end of 
each phase
 (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control). However, teams can set custom 
milestones, and sponsors might require specific milestones if they are approving large resourcing or 
funding requests for a project.
 You can also set up milestones within a te
am environment to manage goals and tasks; these milestones 
can be kept within the team. For example, a team working for a chain of sandwich shops is hoping to 

improve the process by which sandwiches are put together. They have set up the following mileston
es:
 Define: January 21
 Measure: February 12
 Analyze: February 22
 Improve: March 15
 Control: April 10
 The milestone dates are when the team or the Black Belt will meet with the sponsor to present the 
findings or results of each phase of the project. Each da
te gives the team something to work toward. 
However, the team has determined that certain tasks must be accomplished during the Measure phase. 
First, they have to create some definitions of terms so everyone is on the same page when discussing 
measurements
. Second, the team has to gather data about the temperature at which ingredients are 
stored and cooked. Finally, the team wants to actively observe sandwich shop employees in order to 
measure the time it takes to make various sandwiches.

 The team might set
 up 
internal milestones for the Measure phase, stating that definitions will be 
created by January 25, temperature data collected by February 5, and time data collected by February 
10. 
 By breaking each phase, and each larger task, into smaller parts, it i
s easier for the team to stay on track 
and complete work. Smaller tasks seem more manageable, so they are more likely to be accomplished. 
 Budgets
 Teams, and espe
cially team leaders, must always be concerned with project budgets. While success is 
rated by end customers in terms of performance, quality, and satisfaction, Six Sigma teams also answer 
to corporate leadership. For leaders, success is also measured in te
rms of time and budget. A strong 
timeline and good milestones help you meet time requirements, and an understanding of financial 
drivers, strong communication, and financial oversight help you keep a project within budget.
 One of the challenges when 
dealing with budgets in a Six Sigma project is that all team members are not 
always completely aware of financial drivers. In some cases, financial information might even be 
restricted; employers don™t generally want specific data about employee pay made p
ublic to various 
team members, for example. Some information and analysis might need to be performed solely by a 
project
-leading Black Belt in such cases, especially if data is critical or sensitive.
 Outside of concerns with sensitive data, process improve
ment projects work best when all team 
members are made aware of as many of the drivers and data as possible. When teams know how much 
funding a champion is willing to seek on their behalf, they can make realistic decisions about how to 
improve a process. S
ometimes, the solution that is most likely to generate the most improvement isn™t 
viable because of budget. If an improvement project has a budget of $50,000, the team can™t implement 
a solution that requires an $80,000 capital investment in machinery, for
 example.
 Budget concerns vary by organization. In some organizations, leaders are most concerned with specific 
expenditures by a team, including expenses on new equipment, hiring new personnel, or purchasing 
new products or software. Some organizations ta
ke a more granular approach to project budgets, 
considering the expense of hours spent by the team on the project as well as the expenses associated 

with training and implementing a solution outside of the team environment.
 Six Sigma team leaders must ensu
re they understand how leaders and organizations manage project 
budgets. Working for the first time with an organization or sponsor means having honest and thorough 
conversations about how budgets are calculated, how much sponsors are willing to work for i
ncreases in 
a budget, and what the Six Sigma leader™s expected role in maintaining budgets is.
 Defined Measures of Success
 Finally, Six Sigma teams must create a well
-defined measure of success.
 To best manage a Six Sigma 
project and team, leaders have to ensure all team members, leaders, and sponsors agree on what 
success means. If success isn™t defined at all, the team risks scope creep and getting lost in a project that 
never seems to end. 
If success isn™t well
-defined, teams risk concluding a project without satisfying the 
customer, sponsor, or all members of the team. If a sponsor and the team don™t agree on what success 

looks like, the team could think they™ve concluded a successful proje
ct while leadership believes the 
project was a failure.

 In the end, successful Six Sigma team management hinges on many of the same concepts as successful 
leadership in other endeavors does. Choosing the right people, being clear about expectations, 
appro
aching work in an organized manner, and being honest and open about progress helps every 
member of the team succeed and provide value.

 Chapter 11: Introduction to DMAIC and 
DMADV
  One of the things that sets Six Sigma apart from some other quality improv
ement and management 
methodologies is a structured approach to every project. Projects that are meant to improve an existing 
process follow a road
-map for success known as the DMAIC process; DMAIC is broken into five phases: 
Define, Measure, Analyze, Impro
ve, and Control. The main activities of a DMAIC project include 
identifying the critical inputs or causes (the Xs) that are creating the problem (the Y), verifying those 
causes, brainstorming and selecting solutions, implementing solutions, and creating a 
control plan to 
ensure the improved state is maintained.
 The DMAIC methodology is designed to be fairly inclusive 
Œ the vast majority of teams who are seeking 
to improve a project will be able to fit their activities in to the DMAIC steps because those ste
ps are 
designed to allow some flexibility. Sometimes, though, teams realize that fixing or improving a process 
isn™t the right way to achieve sustained improvement for the organization. Instead, a process might need 
to be completely replaced or redesigned 
to meet goals for customer satisfaction or organizational 
improvement. In such cases, teams can employ the DMADV method.
 DMADV stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify. The principles governing the method 
are very similar to those governing 
DMAIC, but the last two phases are geared toward rolling out and 
testing a completely new process. Six Sigma teams might approach improvements through DMADV if:
  The business wants to launch a new service or product.
  Business leaders decide to replace a pro
cess because of upgrade needs or to align business 
processes, machinery, or employees with future goals.
  A Six Sigma team discovers that improving a process is not likely to provide the success desired 
from a project.
 Most teams go into the project knowing
 whether they are employing DMAIC or DMADV approaches, but 
some DMAIC projects can become DMADV projects 
Œ usually during the Define, Measure, or Analyze 
stages 
Œ when the team realizes the need for a complete process replacement. Switching to the new 
meth
odology during the middle of the project might require some shuffling of resources and could 
impact project schedules, which means keeping champions and sponsors informed of team progress and 
decisions is imperative.
 It™s worth noting that some organizatio
ns don™t 
formally 
use the DMADV approach for any project, in 
part because they find it easier to stick with the nomenclature of a single methodology. These 
organizations might still complete process redesign projects by altering some of the activities handled in 
the Improve
 and Control stages of DMAIC. In short, the teams 
do use the DMADV approach, but they 
use the verbiage associated with DMAIC to streamline Six Sigma education across all levels of the 

organization.

 DMAIC versus DMADV
 The major differences between DMAIC an
d DMADV are the goals the team sets and the outcome of the 
completed project. In some ways, a DMADV project might feel like it has a more tangible outcome, but 
in reality, both methods are seeking to deliver better quality, better efficiency, more producti
on, more 
profits, high
er customer satisfaction, or some combination of these things. We™ll introduce each of the 
phases of both methods in this chapter
. But first, let™s look at some quick definitions of e
ach phase as 
they relate to DMAIC versus DMADV.
 Phase 1: Define
 During a DMAIC project, the Define phase is concerned with identifying the problem, defining 
requirements for the project, and setting goals for success. Requirements and goal setting might re
late 
to a variety of factors and are dependent somewhat on guidance from the leadership team and 
expected budgets, and Six Sigma leaders can use various tools within the phase to create flexibility that 

allows for a variety of project types. 
 In a DMADV project, the Define stage is slightly more rigid. 

Teams also have to identify a problem and begin defining 

requirements, but requirements must be
 made within a 
change
-management environment. Sometimes, 
organizations have a change management program in place, 

which means Six Sigma teams must incorporate all 

requirements of that program into the DMADV phases. The 
team also works to define customer re
quirements to create 
a measuring stick to which the process development can be 
compared.
 Phase 2: Measure
 The DMAIC Measure phase is when teams use data to 
validate their assumptions about the process and the 
problem. Validation of assumptions also merges 
into the 
analyze phase. The bulk of the measure phase is occupied 
with actually gathering data and formatting it in a way that 
can be analyzed. Measuring can be one of the most difficult 
tasks in a Six Sigma project if data isn™t already being 
captured. Te
ams might have to build tools to capture data, 
create queries for digital data, sift through enormous 

amounts of data to find relevant information, or capture 
data
 by hand in some manual process.
 After validating assumptions from the Define stage with a
ctual data, the team might revisit problem 
statements, goals, and other process
-related definitions. If the team leaves Define with a ﬁrough draftﬂ 
of these things, they should leave Measure with a final draft. Teams also work during Measure phases to 

meas
ure key inputs and steps in the process in preparation for Define. 
 What is 
Change Management?
 Change management refers to a 

closely
-managed process of making 
changes in an organization. Often, 
companies use change management 
policies and rules to govern how 

changes are made to software, 
infrastructure, or processes that have 
comp
liance or audit elements.
 During change management, teams 

must document all activity in keeping 

with corporate policies and report 
changes and results to an oversight 
committee. Sometimes, Six Sigma 
projects involve changes that are also 

governed by these 
policies, which 
means Six Sigma leaders must be 

prepared to report to change 
management committees.

 Teams working through a DMADV approach might do some of the same things during the Measure 
phase, but activities are typically more targeted. Teams will likely collect data and measurement
s that 
help them define performance requirements for the new process.
  Phase 3: Analyze
 During the Analyze phase of a DMAIC project, teams develop hypothes
es about causal relationships 
between inputs and outputs and between Xs and Ys, they narrow causation
 down to the vital few (using 
methods such as the Pareto principle), and they use statistical analysis and data to validate the 
hypothes
es and assumptions they™ve made so far. The Analyze phase tends to flow into the Improve 
phase in a DMAIC project; hypot
hesis testing to validate assumptions and possible solutions might begin 
in Analyze and continue into the Improve phase.
 A team using DMADV might also identify cause and effect relationships, but they are usually more 
concerned with identifying best practi
ces and benchmarks by which to measure and design the new 
process. 
Teams might also begin process design work by identifying value
- and non
 value
-added 
activities, locating areas where bottlenecks or errors are likely, and refining requirements to better 
meet 
the needs and goals of the project.
 Phase 4: Improve or Design
 Six Sigma teams start developing the ideas that began in the Analyze phase during the Improve phase of 
a project. They use statistics and real
-world observation to test hypothes
es and solu
tions. Hypothesis 
testing actually begins in the analyze phase, but is continued during the improve phase as teams select 
solutions and begin to implement them. Teams also work to standardize solutions in preparation for 
rolling improved processes to daily
 production and non
-team employees. Teams also start measuring 
results and lay the foundation for controls that will be built in the last phase.
 The fourth phase is where DMADV projects begin to diverge substantially from DMAIC projects. The 
team actually 
works to design a new process, which does involve some of the solutions testing 
mentioned above, but also involves mapping, workflow principles, and actively building new 

infrastructures. That might mean putting new equipment in place, hiring and training 
new employees, or 
developing new software tools. Teams also start to implement the new systems and processes during 
the fourth phase.
 Phase 5: Control or Verify
 For DMAIC and DMADV teams, the control or verify phase is where loose ends are tied and the pro
ject is 
transitioned to a daily work environment. Controls and standards are established so that improvements 
can be maintained, but the responsibility for those improvements is transitioned to the process owner. 

During the transition, the Six Sigma team m
ight work with the process owner and his or her department 
to troubleshoot any problems with the improvement.
 Which Methodology Would You Use?
 Consider the following improvement projects. Which methodology do you think a Six Sigma team might 

use to approac
h each project?

 1. A business wants to create a smartphone app to help customers make and manage 
appointments.
 2. A doctor™s office has had numerous complaints from patients because it is too hard to get 
appointments, appointment communications are confusing, or
 patients show up for 
appointments and are told they don™t have an appointment.
 3. A company that manufactures pizza boxes isn™t happy with the profit margins in the small size 
boxes.
 The team handling an improvement for the business in example 1 would choose
 a DMADV approach. 
They are creating a product that doesn™t yet exist; while the team is meeting a need that already exists 
and is improving an overall process 
Œ the setting of appointments 
Œ the app itself is a new process and a 
new product. The app will 
need to be designed, integrated into existing systems, and the final product 
tested before full implementation.
 Example 2 is for an existing process, so the team would begin with a DMAIC approach. It™s possible that 
the team might determine during the proc
ess that one solution might be to develop a new 
appointment
-setting software or replace existing software with something from a different vendor. In 
some cases, that might warrant a switch to DMADV, but, as previously stated, not all organizations 
would do
 so. Some organizations would continue with the DMAIC process and modify the activities in 
each phase to fit the needs of the project at hand.
 Example 3 is a classic example of what brings many teams to the DMAIC method. The problem hasn™t 

yet been defined
, but the organization knows that goals and expectations are not being met. A 
leadership team might work with subject matter experts and one or more Six Sigma experts to discover 
more about the processes involved before settling on one or more improvement 
projects.
 Define
 During the Define phase of a Six Sigma process improvement project, teams create what is known as a 

project charter and a basic plan for work. 
A charter is a synopsis of the project. It provides some 
common information and a summary of what the team hopes to accomplish. The charter usually 
features a list of team members, names of those responsible for outcomes, a problem statement, a goal, 
and so
me basic definitions of scope and metrics for success. Some charters also include a rough timeline 
estimate for the project.
 Also during the Define phase, teams create or list measurable customer requirements and create high
-level documents about the proce
ss (including process maps). Often, teams will start with a SIPOC 
diagram to help them begin to understand a process. Teams should also identify stakeholders during the 

Define phase. Stakeholders are individuals, both within and without an organization, wh
o have some 
level of influence on the success of an improvement project. By understanding who stakeholders are, 
teams can remain in contact with various persons throughout the project, communicating with those 
stakeholders as needed to ensure future viabil
ity of any improvement that is created. One way to 
identify stakeholders is through a Stakeholder Analysis
. Tips for Positive Movement in the Define Stage
 One of the biggest challenges Six Sigma teams face when in the Define
 phase of a project is generating 
positive, targeted momentum that sets the foundation for the rest of the project. As a Six Sigma team

 leader, you can increase chances of success by keeping the team as focused as possible during the 
Define stage. Begin by
 explaining the Six Sigma process and the purpose of the project for any ancillary 
team members who may not be familiar with Six Sigma and DMAIC. Next, work as a team to create 
ground rules for how the project will run 
Œ including how meetings are organize
d and managed, how 
information will be communicated, and what each team member might be responsible for during the 
project. 
 Create a charter and project plan so the team has something to focus on
. If possible, have the Champion 
of the project spend time with the team. Hearing directly from an executive leader about expectations 

and the support of leadership for the project helps motivate a team. At the same time, ensure the 
Champion doesn™t ste
p in to take over the project, as this isn™t his or her role. 
 Define is also a good time to explain the roles of scribe and time keeper and talk about the purpose of 
brainstorming. Some Six Sigma leaders like to let team members take turns facilitating va
rious exercises 
for the group, as this integrates each person more tightly within the process and helps team members at 
all levels learn more about Six Sigma.
  Measure
 Once a team has a good grasp of what the process does and how it works, what the problem
 is, and 
what the goal for the project is, the team moves from Define to Measure. Usually, the transition 
between phases is marked by a tollgate review wherein the team presents its Define work to a 
champion or a Six Sigma leadership board. The champion or
 board provides feedback and makes the 
decision about whether the team is ready to move on to Measure.
 During the Measure phase, the team is concerned with creating a baseline metric for the process and 
refining problem statements and other outputs of the 
Define stage. Creating a baseline metric lets 
teams understand how a process should be measured and how the process is really performing before 
improvements begin. It also provides a comparison point so teams can show how much improvement 
they™ve brought t
o a project at the end of the DMAIC method.
 One of the biggest challenges, especially for teams and team members who are new to the Six Sigma 
method, can be deciding what to measure. Many times, inexperienced teams end up spending time 
collecting data that
 doesn™t provide answers or can™t be used for the process. Because the Measure 
phase starts with some educated guesswork and trial
-and
-error, teams and Six Sigma leaders have to 
keep a close eye on progress and redirect work when measurements are not creat
ing the answers or 
production required.
 A successful Measure phase requires strong observation skills, an understanding of the reasons behind 
measure, knowledge of data types such as discrete and continuous, tools for measurement assessment, 
and a strong b
ackground in statistical analysis. Some of the tools often deployed in the Measure phase, 
such as the CTQ tree and sigma level calculation, were covered in previous chapters. 
 Tips for an Effective Measure Phase
 The Measure phase is often the most challenging phase for a Six Sigma team leader, especially when 
working with teams that are inexperienced in the methodology. When teams start to really dig deep

 into a process and begi
n to measure things, they often get a true idea about how challenging the 
problem really is. They might also have a difficult time understanding how and when to measure things, 
and collecting data that hasn™t been collected before can be time consuming and
 tedious. Because of all 
these challenges, teams might enter what is called a storming stage
Šteam members question the 
viability of the project, rail against the Champion or the team leader, complain how much time the 
project is taking from other duties, o
r stop showing up to meetings altogether.
 Six Sigma leaders can reduce the impact of storming on a team by demonstrating a calm approach to 

each aspect of the project and redirecting the strong emotion of storming to more productive work. If 

you can identi
fy an easy task or problem, letting the team work on that and accomplish something 
immediately can reduce the excitement of storming; Six Sigma leaders should also ensure work is fairly 

distributed and that each team member knows exactly what his or her re
sponsibilities are. 
  Analyze
 Once measurements are collected 
Œ or are in the process of being collected 
Œ Six Sigma teams usually 
move on to the Analyze phase. Again, a tollgate review is often conducted between phases, but the lines 
between Measure and A
nalyze are often blurrier than the lines between Define and Measure. In some 
cases, a team has to measure, analyze, and then measure some more 
Œ particularly if metrics aren™t 
already in place for a process. 
 Analyze phases are when teams perform detective
 work on the process. Using the clues gathered during 
the Define and Measure phases, along with information provided by the sponsor, process owner, and 
subject matter experts, teams attempt to identify root causes for a problem; they also use statistical 

analysis and other tools to verify causes before turning to the work of identifying possible solutions. 
During the Analyze phase, teams use a variety of tools 
Œ some of which were introduced in earlier 
chapters. Tools common in the Analyze phase include Par
eto charts, run charts, histograms, cause
-and
-effect diagrams, scatter diagrams, process maps, and value analysis. 
 As teams work through the Analyze phase, they also start preparing 
for the Improve phase. During 

Analyze, teams might begin working on possible solutions and selecting solutions, developing 

improvement plans, and preparing some basic documentation about improvement work. Whether a 

team begins this work during Analyze ofte
n depends on the individual project and the manner in which 
the Six Sigma team leader would like to proceed. The Six Sigma team leader should ensure that teams 

aren™t taking on too much of the project at one time and that working on early Improve work does
n™t 
reduce the efficacy of the work done for the Analyze phase.
 Tips for a Strong Analyze Phase
 Teams in the Analyze phase might continue to suffer from storming; if teams didn™t storm during Define 
or Measure phases, they might begin to do so in Analyze. 
Six Sigma leaders can use the same tips for 
controlling storming in the Measure phase in the Analyze phase.
 Another common challenge for Six Sigma team leaders is introducing and explaining statistical concepts 
during the Analyze phase. When other team mem
bers or even the champion of the process are not 
familiar with statistical analysis, presenting advanced analysis in terms of statistical verbiage only can be

 a mistake. Team members won™t understand how you came to the conclusions you are presenting, 
whic
h makes it less likely they will get behind the solution or improvement in a positive way.
 Six Sigma experts should be aware of the knowledge limitations of various team members and work to 

both present information in a way that is understood by everyone 
and continue to add to team member 
knowledge by explaining concepts when possible. 
 Improve
 During the Improve phase of a project, a Six Sigma team selects a final solution and begins to put it in 

place. Sometimes, teams will select more than one solution, especially if a few smaller solutions are 
highly relate
d and work together for an overall solution. It can be hard to determine which solution 
actually improves a process, however, so it™s usually a best practice to implement one change at a time 
and verify that change before moving on to something else. 
 Team
s might also come up with many possible solutions, all of which would provide some improvement 
for the process. They should use a solutions selection matrix or other Six Sigma tool to evaluate 

solutions, choosing only the few best solutions. It™s worth not
ing again that the best solution is not 
always the solution that provides the most improvement. Solutions that are so expensive or disruptive 
that they cause disadvantages that outweigh any benefits should never be selected by project teams.
  During Improve, Six Sigma teams must continue to keep the project definitions in mind. The solution 
must address a root cause verified in the Analyze phase; the root cause must be directly related to the 
problem stated during the Define phase. After selecting solutions, teams must test them using statistical 
tools and real
-world sampling to ensure effectiveness before deploying solutions to a live work 
environment.
 Tips for Staying Strong Nearing the End o
f a DMAIC Project
 Possibly the most common problem that plagues Six Sigma teams during the Improve phase is project 
fatigue. By the time teams come to Improve, they have been working on a project for weeks or even 
months; for many team members, the project
 work is on top of regular work. Fatigue or frustration 
might push team members to select and implement solutions just to have the project completed. Six 
Sigma leaders have to work to keep teams motivated on quality and improvement.
 The best way for a Six 
Sigma team leader to create strength as the team nears project completion is to 
build a good foundation for Six Sigma in the earlier phases. Teams that understand the DMAIC process 

and have at least basic understanding of Six Sigma and statistical analysis
 by the Improve phase are 
more likely to stick with planning, analysis, and the DMAIC method. 
 Six Sigma team leaders should also continue to foster a team approach to all aspects of the project. One 
challenge for some leaders is the temptation to take mea
surements and analysis and begin performing 
much of the work themselves. Sometimes, it™s faster and easier to handle decision
-making and analysis 
on your own, especially when you are dealing with team members who aren™t fluent in DMAIC or Six 
Sigma methods
. Doing so alienates team members, though, and can result in a Six Sigma leader without 
direct process knowledge making the wrong decision. Keeping the team involved 
Œ and making exercises 
and meetings fun and productive 
Œ helps you make it through the Imp
rove phase.

 Control
 Control is the final phase for Six Sigma teams employing the DMAIC process. During the Control phase, 
teams usually handle four tasks: creating the foundation for process discipline, finalizing documents 
regarding the improvement, estab
lishing ongoing metrics to evaluate the process, and building a 
process management plan that lets the team transition the improvement to the process owner.
 Tools used by a team during the Control phase include documentation checklists, control charts, 
resp
onse plans, process maps, and process dashboards. 
 The Control Phase
 is often easy for a team because the work of the team has already reached a 
crescendo. In a well
-run DMAIC process, the Control phase is a time of wrapping up loose ends and 
arriving at the end of a project. At the same time, teams might find it challengi
ng to let go of a process 

they have put so much time into. By the time teams reach the Control phase, they might have been 

working with a process for months. If a Six Sigma leader has done his or her job, the team has taken 
ownership of the process and fee
ls personally tied to the quality and output, making it hard to turn the 
work over to other teams or employees.
 Ending on a Positive Note
 Six Sigma leaders can help team members transition a project by preparing them in advance for this 
phase. You might 
also find ways to incorporate team members into meetings or presentations where 
project results are being shared. Six Sigma leaders should always host a meeting to wrap up the project. 
The meeting should be somewhat celebratory in nature 
Œ if budget, time,
 and policy allows, Six Sigma 
leaders might consider having lunch or snacks at the meeting. Take time to recognize each team 
member™s contribution, and ask team members to identify something they learned that can be applied 
to their own work. This helps te
am members see that Six Sigma is an ongoing culture within an 
organization, and the end of a particular project doesn™t equate to the end of each person™s involvement 
in continuous improvement.
 Recognition is extremely important when ending a Six Sigma pro
ject. Team members might have put in 
extra hours to provide excellent work on a project while maintaining their own responsibilities. Often, 
work on a Six Sigma project is not part of a team member™s regular duties, so they are going above and 
beyond what 
might normally be expected of them. Six Sigma leaders should make it a point to recognize 

the work of team members in front of a project sponsor or champion, and, when possible, in front of the 
department for which the improvement is being made.
 Design
 Des
ign is the fourth phase of DMADV; it replaces the Improve phase of DMAIC. DMADV is one approach 
for what is called Design for Six Sigma, or DFSS. Another approach is called DMADOV, which stands for 
Define,  Measure, Analyze, Design, Optimize, and Validate.
 Teams using the DMADV approach usually 
combine the activities from Design and Optimize, and we™ll briefly introduce those activities in this 

section.
 The Design phase of DMADV is when teams create a new process or develop a new product. A Six Sigma 

team w
ould have previously done all the work to lay the foundation for development during the Define, 
Measure, and Analyze stages, which means most of the Design phase is taken up with the actual work 
involved in creating the process or project. 
 Page |

 Using the plans
, instructions, or maps created in earlier phases, the team either creates a product 
themselves or works with vendors, manufacturers, or other employees to create the product. For 
example, if the DMADV project involved the creation of a new app for custome
rs or employees, the 
team might work with staff in the programming and technical departments. They might also work with a 
vendor who will be supplying the app or software in question; in such a case, a representative from the 

vendor should have been part o
f the team throughout all phases.
 During Design, a team will also test the product, process, or service. Testing can be done in testing 

environments, in limited production environments, or via Beta testing. Usually, the team rolls 
out 
the 
new process or pr
oduct to a limited number of internal or external customers; those customers provide 
feedback and the team uses the feedback to troubleshoot the new process or product as needed. 

Seeking feedback and troubleshooting the new process to create the best possi
ble solution is where the 
Optimize in DMADOV comes in.
 Tips for a Successful Design Phase
 In a process redesign project, all phases are essential, but Design is often seen as the most critical. 

Teams that falter in the design phase can waste the work that 
was put into other phases, and it™s easy 
for teams to fall prey to project fatigue just as work requirements pick up for everyone involved. Six 
Sigma team leaders can help improve the chances of a successful Design phase by following the tips for 
managing 
Improve phases. Teams should also be realistic about target dates for design work. Promising 
a complete solution in a short time period pleases leadership at first, but if teams are rushed, they tend 

to deliver low
-quality processes. If you promise a too
-good
-to-be true timeline, you also run the risk of 
running far behind schedule, which can impede the work of other projects and process improvements. 
 Verify
 The Verify phase of a DMADV or DMADOV project is very similar to the Control phase of a DMAIC 
proje
ct. The new process, product, or service is transitioned out of project mode and handed off to a 
process owner or employees who work daily with the process or product in question. Control plans, 
including control charts, might be put in place by the team t
o track ongoing results
, and almost all of the 
tools used in a DMAIC Control phase are relevant to Verify.
 One of the differences between Verify and Control is that DMADV teams might take time to complete 
further CTQ analysis at the end of a project so the
y can identify new critical
-to-quality factors. This is 
done because the process or product is different than it was when the team first started working. While 
the team should have made educated guesses about CTQs for the new product 
Œ and used those CTQs 
in 
planning and designing 
Œ they could not predict 100 percent how the customer might react to the new 
product or process. A new process might have a capability the old one did not; having that capability, 
the customer might decide it is the most important
 factor in quality about the process or product.
 At the end of the Verify phase, a team delivers a final product or process that meets the needs first 
identified in the Define stage. The process or product should be free of known problems and defects 
where
ver possible, and teams should have provided a way to manage and control the process through 
statistical control charts, Lean templates, and policies.

 Closing a DMADV Project
 One of the major differences between DMAIC and DMADV is the possible timeline. W
e previously stated 
that a problem fits the DMAIC model if it can be solved in less than six months. While some DMADV 
projects might only take a few months, many process or product designs can take years. Because of this, 
the concluding challenges for a DM
ADV team are similar to those in a DMAIC environment, but they 
might be heightened by the length of time a team has spent on a project.
 Team members who have spent a year or more working to develop a new process or product might feel 
like the end of the pr
oject threatens their job. This is especially true when team members have not been 
handling regular work duties in addition to product duties. Six Sigma leaders and champions can reduce 
these worries by communicating next steps and expectations clearly wit
h staff.
 Team members who have been working on regular job duties alongside project work for years might 
find it hard to return to regular duties without something else to work on. One of the benefits of Six 
Sigma is that team members learn to expect more 
of themselves, their coworkers, and an organization™s 
processes. Six Sigma team leaders can work with employees returning to daily work and help them apply 

what they learned in a positive fashion within their respective departments.
 Finally, Six Sigma team
 leaders should ensure that a DMADV project closes on a positive note by 
validating all team members and ensuring process owners have all the tools they need to accept the 

new process without disrupting work. 
  Breaking up the Elephant
 You should now have a basic understanding of how a Six Sigma team approaches a problem or process 
improvement. Whether improving an existing process or creating a new process or product, teams work 
through phased approaches. The phases of DMAIC and DMADV p
rovide control and organization for a 
project, help keep everyone on task, and let teams break up what can seem like enormous tasks into 
chunks that are tolerable. 
As the old adage says: How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. 
Similarly, the phased
 approach of Six Sigma breaks up the elephant 
so teams can work on it one bite at a 
time

 Unit 3: Advanced DMAIC
 Chapter 12: Define
  Six Sigma teams enter the project process with various levels of information. Sometimes, a problem is 
fairly well def
ined before the team begins work, particularly in organizations that use a Six Sigma 
leadership council to choose projects and create teams. Other times, teams begin work with little 
information except that a problem 
Œ of some type 
Œ exists because the out
comes of a process are not as 
expected. Teams might not know where errors are occurring or even begin a project with a complete 
understanding of the inputs and outputs associated with the process.
 Whatever knowledge teams begin with, the define phase is wh
en teams move from very basic 
information about a process or problem to the knowledge and organization necessary to enter measure 
and subsequent other phases with a successful foundation. In the define phase, teams set rules, create a 
charter that will gov
ern efforts moving forward, identify stakeholders and customers, define a process 
through process mapping, and prepare for a define tollgate 
before 
entering the measure phase.
 Creating a Project Charter
 A project charter, or team charter, is a short docume
nt that includes information about the team and 
what they plan to accomplish. The purpose of the charter is to set expectations that can be agreed upon 
by the team as well as the sponsor or executive leaders, keep the team focused on the goal, ensure the 
project remains aligned with the goals of the business, and documents the fact that control of a process 
is being moved from a business executive or manager to a Six Sigma project team.
 Minimally, team charters should include:
  A complete and concise problem
 statement that follows the guidelines set out in Chapter 6.
  A list of critical to quality metrics, or those measurements that will ultimately determine project 
or process success. Critical to quality was introduced in chapter 8.
  The names and roles of eac
h person on the team. Selecting team members and appropriate 
team member roles are covered in Chapter 10.
  A list of both internal and external process customers. Use a SIPOC, discussed in Chapter 7, to 

begin defining internal or external customers. 
  The na
me of a sponsor and/or champion.
  A duration for the project.
 Teams might also include information such as a list of non
-customer stakeholders, an estimated 
schedule for each phase of the project, scope definitions for the process or project, and financial 
drivers 

for the project. 
 The information for the team charter usually can™t be gathered in a single brainstorming session; the 

charter is an outcome of the entire define phase, not a quick notation at the beginning. By taking time to 
properly consider all
 elements of a team charter, Six Sigma teams create a stronger foundation for the 
rest of their work.

 Benefits of an Organizational Team Charter Template
 Businesses that are implementing Six Sigma organization
-wide might consider creating or using a 
specif
ic template for team charters. Templates streamline define phases and make it easy for leadership 
teams and other employees to understand critical process components at a glance. While final team 
documentation is likely to be extensive, and even in the def
ine phase, teams themselves might work 
with lengthy requirements documents, charters themselves should be as concise as possible. Some 
organizations distill charters to a single page while others use multipage documents. A sample one
-page 
charter template 
is attached at the end of this chapter. 
 Details for
 Charter Elements
 We™ve covered some of the most important elements of the charter in detail in previous chapters, but 
here™s a quick look at some of the items we didn™t cover in as much detail and are wo
rth mentioning 
again.
 Business Case
 The business case might also be referred to as the financial drivers behind a project. Related closely to 
the problem statement, the business case is a short statement that provides a reason the project should 
be 
undertaken. The problem statement tells someone where, when, and how; the business case says 
why it™s important. If you think back to Chapter 6, we said dollar amounts or another financial metric 

were important to include in the problem statement. If you i
nclude a business case in your charter, you 
would build on that basic financial statement to explain why, specifically, the loss of money, efficiency, 
or quality is important to consumers, employees, or the organization. You might also make an argument 
for
 why the problem must be solved now; in essence, why is this project being run now in place of 
another project?
 Project Scope
 We introduced the concept of scope briefly in Chapter 6. For the purposes of the team charter, the 
scope should include a hard beg
inning and end of the process or problem being considered. You might 
also include a short list of items or activities that are in scope and out of scope for your project. A SIPOC 
diagram helps teams identify the parameters for a project, and you can also u
se the In and Out of the 
Box method described later in this chapter to understand the intended scope of a project.
 The scope should be clear. Listing the scope for a project or process as ﬁbeginning at the order stage and 
ending with fulfillmentﬂ isn™t cle
ar, because different people might consider different points the 
beginning of the order stage or the end of fulfillment. A better scope statement might be ﬁbeginning 
when a customer places an order and ending when the order is boxed for shipment.ﬂ Going ev
en 
further, a team might deem return and replacement processes out of scope for a project so that they 
are only dealing with original orders. Successful projects have a well
-defined scope that is approved and 
backed by a project sponsor or champion.
 List t
he Stakeholders
 Listing major stakeholders on the charter helps the team remember who and what they are likely to 
impact in addition to end customers. Having the list visible during meetings reduces the chance that the 

team will initiate changes that might
 have a negative or unwanted effect on other process owners or 
processes, and it helps direct the team to resources outside of the team that can provide help, access, or 
information to areas related to the project.

 Team Member Roles
 Team members and roles 
were covered in Chapter 10, and the team charter simply needs to list the 
names of all team members along with their role and expected time commitment. Adding time 
commitments to the charter helps sponsors and executive leadership understand the human reso
urce 
requirements for the project; often a Six Sigma team leader has to seek approval for staff members from 
other areas to devote a specified amount of time to the project. 
 Time commitments can be listed in hours per week but are often listed as a percen
t of the employee™s 
overall time. For example, a subject
 matter
 expert who is expected to attend all of the team meetings to 
provide input, but is not expected to complete data collection, analysis, or improvement work
, might be 
listed as providing 10 perc
ent of his or her time to the team. A list of team members in a charter might 
look something like the list below.  You don™t have to list all the staff members you might possibility 
consult during the course of the project.
  Mike Smith, Black Belt, 100%
  Cha
se Michaels, Green Belt, 100%
  Lisa Javes, Green Belt, 100%
  Rosalie Myers, Process Owner, 25%
  Brent Reed, subject
 matter
 expert, 10%
  Brenda Tran, subject
 matter
 expert, 10%
 Milestones
 In Chapter 10, we covered creating a draft schedule for a Six Sigma proje
ct. The diagram included in 
Chapter 10 that broke down the timeline for a project is called a Gantt chart. Adapted by Henry Gantt in 
the early 20
th century, a Gantt chart is a bar chart that displays the phases of a project according to time. 
One of the be
nefits of using a Gantt chart to display a rough project schedule is that it can easily be 
included in a one
-page project charter; anyone reviewing the charter can quickly visualize the time 
element required for the project.
 Teams should ensure a date is p
rovided for the end of each of the DMAIC phases and that all team 
members agree that the dates are plausible given what the group wants to do. In some cases, 
milestones might be set by the project sponsor or champion, but the team should agree that milesto
ne 
dates are possible. If dates seem implausible, teams can present a counter schedule with logical 
arguments regarding why the original schedule wouldn™t work. 
 In addition to milestones at the end of each project phase, Six Sigma teams might also want to
 set 
milestones for work within each phase 
Œ specifically for the more laborious measure, analyze, and 
improve phases. While the team should document all milestones it agrees on, detailed milestones don™t 
necessarily belong in the one
-page charter document
.   Measurement of Success
 Everyone needs to know how the team is going to measure success. If a sponsor is measuring success on 
customer satisfaction scores and the team is measuring success on internal quality scores, ideas about 
the outcome of the project are likely to differ. Us
ually, measures of success can be pulled from the 
critical to quality metrics discussed in Chapter 8. If teams can convert a CTQ to a measurement, they can 
understand what major metrics determine success of a project. While teams might begin to gather

 meas
urements or look at existing measurements while in the define phase, finalization of metrics can 
extend into the measure phase.
 Expected Financial Benefits
 Financial information is already likely included on the charter in both the business case and the pr
oblem 
statement. Teams might include expected financial benefits in the business case section of a charter, but 
it must be included somewhere. For some sponsors and executive leaders, the financial benefit is the 
most important piece of information include
d in a charter. An estimated savings or increase in revenue 
also provides a measuring stick by which leaders can consider requests for resources for a project.
 A Six Sigma expert should 
never
 over extend estimates regarding financial benefits; it™s almost 
always 
better to under
-promise and over
-perform. If you tell leaders a project will save $500,000 in the first 
year because a big number means you™re more likely to get project approval and all the resources you 

ask for, you™re the one that answers when th
e project saves only $80,000. As with any aspect of a Six 
Sigma project, be as accurate as possible, but be conservative with estimates when accuracy is in 

question.
 Review the Charter with Success in Mind
 Before a Six Sigma team presents a charter for app
roval, it should take time to review the document as a 
group to ensure the charter lays a foundation for success. Some questions a team might ask itself about 

a charter include:
  Is everything
Šespecially the goals, financial expectations, and 
timeline
Šchallenging but 
realistic?
  Can everyone on the team devote the committed amount of time to the project?
  Is the project backed by a sponsor or champion with enough influence to drive critical 

assistance and resources?
  Does the team expect to be sup
ported by auxiliary departments such as information 
technology, human resources, compliance, accounting, or legal as necessary for project 

success?
  Does the team expect to have the necessary freedom to implement a solution it designs after 
the solution is 
approved by the sponsor, champion, or executive steering committee?
  Does the team have a leader who is well
-versed in Six Sigma tools and project management?
 If the answer to any of the questions above is no, then the team could be setting itself up for fa
ilure. 
Before moving forward, the team should address these concerns and, if possible, make changes that 
convert no answers to yes answers.
 Project Ground Rules
 Before moving forward with any work 
Œ even defining a team charter 
Œ it™s a good idea for a Six
 Sigma 
team to establish some basic rules and requirements for the team. We touched briefly on this in Chapter 

10 when discussing management of a team. The ground rules for a project should be maintained in 
writing and approved by all team members, but the
y don™t have to be part of an official charter 
document. The reason for documenting the rules and having all team members approve them is 
because a single team member cannot later claim to be ignorant of the rules.
 Page | 
132

 At the same time, rule generation on a Si
x Sigma team shouldn™t be a completely democratic process. 
Some of the more common sense or critical rules can be provided by the Black Belt or team leader. For 
example, ground rules should cover topics such as who should attend each meeting and the fact t
hat 
team members should hold certain information confidential. A Black Belt might simply state that team 
members should observe confidentiality and attendance rules, be on time to meetings, and respect each 

other. The team itself will likely vote on the fr
equency of meetings and when meetings should be 
scheduled. Seeking team member input ensures that all team members can actually commit to meeting 
time slots. For consistency, it™s best to hold meetings on the same days and at the same time each week, 
but i
t™s understandably difficult to keep such a schedule through the entire life of some projects.
 Black 
Belts might also provide some tips and suggestions for how team members should participate 
during meetings, particularly during group brainstorming session
s. For more information on running a 
brainstorming session, see Chapter 35. Black 
Belts should also dictate the rules for creating an agenda 
and running a meeting according to the agenda, though they might delegate some of these functions 
such as time keep
er and secretary.
 Define Toolset
 We™ve covered a number of define tools in previous chapters, including the SIPOC diagram and the 5 

Whys. Process maps and value stream mapping are two advanced Six Sigma tools that are often used in 
the define stage
. Some Six Sigma teams begin using run charts to start defining a baseline in the define 
phase; run charts are covered in Chapter 13 on the measure phase. 
 In this section, we™ll cover three additional tools that are common to the define phase: the Stakeholder 

Analysis, the In and Out of the Box Method, and the Is/Is Not Matrix.
 Stakeh
older Analysis
 A stakeholder analysis is a quick way to identify how various people within an organization relate to a 

project and how the team should keep them informed. Begin the analysis with a grid drawn over an x 
and y axis. The vertical axis represen
ts the amount of power a person has in the organization. The 
horizontal axis represents the amount of interest a person has in the team™s project. The stakeholder 
analysis works best when teams conduct it on a whiteboard or large flipchart. Draw the basic 
diagram, 

as seen in the figure below, in large format.
 Page | 
133
  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
  Provide the team with sticky notes. Ask them to write down possible stakeholders for a project or 
process. Stakeholders are anyone who has an interest in the project, who might benefit from the 
outco
me of the project, or who might be impacted by the work done via the project. Take a few minutes 
to discuss the names that were brainstormed and discard any the team feels are not actually 
stakeholders.
 Once the team decides who the stakeholders are, begin
 placing the names on the chart according to 
power and interest. People with both low power and little interest will be placed in the lower left 

corner. People with higher power and low interest are placed in the upper left; people with less power 

but a lo
t of interest are placed in the lower right corner, and people with high levels of power and a lot 
of interest are placed in the upper right corner. A name might be placed high and to the right of the 
lower
-left corner if the stakeholder has a moderate amo
unt of interest and power, but the team doesn™t 
feel like the person quite crosses the line. Likewise, a name placed at the lower bounds of any quadrant 
might show lower amounts of power than those placed nearer the top of the box; the stakeholder 

analysis
 lets teams prioritize stakeholders in this manner, even within the four quadrants.
 Each of the quadrants of the diagram correlate loosely to the type of stakeholder, providing some 
guidance on how the team might interact with each person or department lis
ted.
 Top Left: Keep Satisfied
 Stakeholders that fall into the top left quadrant of the diagram have enough power that they could 
interfere with a project, but they aren™t extremely interested in the day
-to-day outcomes. The team 
should ensure these individ
uals are satisfied in whatever way they do interact with the project. Teams

 might also consult with these individuals at various times during the project. For example, a team 
working to solve problems of shipping in a warehouse might need to consult with p
rocurement 
managers at some point because the team identifies a need for a different type of packing tape. 
Procurement leaders have power over obtaining the resource, but they might not have a great deal of 
interest in the project overall.
 Sometimes, teams
 might identify a stakeholder that falls into this section and realize that it would be 
valuable to the team for that particular stakeholder to be more invested in the project. Six Sigma leaders 

can work with stakeholders to try to move someone from low in
terest to high interest categories 
Œ this 
is a political tactic that some teams use to bolster support for a project. 
 Bottom Left: Minimal Effort
 Stakeholders that fall into the bottom left quadrant have the least important connection to a project. 
Teams 
will mostly communicate general information about a project via newsletters or email to these 
stakeholders. While these stakeholders take minimal effort from teams, some situations might exist 
where teams want to move stakeholders from this box to the lowe
r-right box.
 Bottom Right: Keep Informed
 Individuals in the lower
-right box have a strong tie or interest in the project, but do not have access to 
power to support projects from a resource standpoint. These stakeholders might include employees in 
departme
nts related to the process being improved or subject matter experts that will be consulted 
about individual aspects of a project. 
 While stakeholders in the lower
-right quadrant can™t usually bring resources to bear, they 
can act in 
support of a project, o
ften in the form of a goodwill ambassador. 
 Top Right: Key Player
  Individuals in the top
-right quadrant are either key players regarding a process or executive leaders with 
the ability to assign resources to a project. These are the individuals teams will
 report to at various 
tollgates; often, the executives responsible for the ultimate success of a process or project appear in the 

top
-right quadrant.
  In and Out of the Box Method
 The In and Out of the Box method is a quick and easy method that helps teams
 define project or process 
scope. Begin by drawing a large box on a whiteboard or flip chart. Provide markers and sticky notes for 
the team. Ask the team to write down elements of the process to be worked on, including resources, 

activities, and people. Ea
ch item should be written on a sticky note. Work together to create as 
complete a list as possible, placing the sticky notes on a wall or table as you go. Make sure everyone on 
the team understands that there are no wrong answers and the first phase of the
 exercise doesn™t 
require discussion. By brainstorming items with little
-to-no discussion, teams can capture more ideas, 
leading to a more accurate picture of what is in and out of scope.
 Once a comprehensive list is made, begin working as a team to assign
 each item to a place inside, on the 
line, or outside of the box. Items outside of the box are those that will be considered out of scope for

 the project. Teams might place items outside of the box because they don™t have access or control over 
the items, 
they don™t have time to work on the items, or they have specifically been told not to include 
the item in the project.
 Items that are within the box are considered in scope for the project. These should be elements of the 
process the team can reasonably be
 expected to influence. If the team isn™t sure yet where an item 
might fall, they should place it on the line. Items that go on the line might be ones that the team hopes 
to be able to impact but for which the team leader needs to seek permission or assist
ance from 
someone outside the team.
 Once all items are placed on, in, or outside of the box, review the placements as a team and make any 

changes. Document the exercise by photographing the diagram or recreating it on a computer. The team 

might reflect bac
k on the diagram when attempting to control scope creep or considering who they 
should approach for help with a project.
  Is/Is Not Matrix
 The Is/Is Not Matrix is another quick brainstorming tool teams can use to define scope. It can also be 
used to help d
efine some of the information necessary to a problem statement. The matrix works by 
considering specific things about the process or project and coming up with both is and is not answers.
 For example, if a Six Sigma team is tasked with determining why the 
furnaces in a certain factory are not 

heating to proper temperatures, they might create an Is/Is Not Matrix like the one below.
  Is Is Not
 Where
 South plant
 North or East plan
 What
 Steam furnaces
 Wood furnaces
 When
 January 2015
 Prior to January 2015
  The matrix clearly shows that the scope of the project only includes work at the south plant on the 
steam furnaces. The problem was noted in January 2015, which provides the team with a starting point 
for gathering data. This is a very simple matrix; teams
 can ask as many questions as they like to narrow 
down scope or better understand processes and projects through the Is/Is Not structure.
 Define Tollgate Checklist
 A successful define phase ends with all of the following deliverables:
 o A comprehensive proje
ct statement
 o A team charter

 Chapter 13: Measure 
  Moving from the define phase to the measure phase of a project, Six Sigma teams continue to delve into 
the process, now coming to understand processes more fully
 through data. The measure phase is often 
the most laborious phase for the team, especially when data is not already available in digital formats. In 

this chapter, we™ll review some of the metrics covered in previous chapters and introduce some 
concepts fo
r data collection. We™ll continue building on the concepts of measure introduced in later 
chapters on statistical analysis.
 One of the first steps of the measure phase is determining the capability of a process. This step can be 

completed before a team for
mally leaves the define phase if the data needed to perform sigma level 
calculations is available. Calculating sigma levels for a process was covered in Chapter 1. In addition to 
sigma levels, teams might also calculate various metrics for a process, inclu
ding defects per million 
opportunities, FTY, or RTY, which were all covered in Chapter 5.  
 Failure Modes and Effect Analysis
 The Failure Modes and Effect Analysis is a tool that can be applied by a Six Sigma team in any phase 

from define to analyze. 
Often, teams begin working with FMEAs in measure because it helps them 
identify risk priorities for various inputs and errors within a process. Used properly, the FMEA uses 
systemic data and team input to set the stage for root cause analysis in the next D
MAIC phase. 
Remember, while tollgates do occur and teams move through five phases during a DMAIC project, hard 
borders don™t always exist between the phases. Teams might begin working on measure phase tasks 
before leaving the define phase, and it™s almost 
certain that teams will begin some analysis while still 
collecting data.
 Ultimately, an FMEA tool should be used when teams need more detailed information about inputs and 
possible associated fail
-points than the tools discussed in the define chapter allow
. The FMEA offers 
some of the information that is offered by SIPOC, but it also provides evaluations of the inputs. Teams 
typically create FMEAs in a spreadsheet program, as some calculations are required during the process.
 To create an FMEA, create a spr
eadsheet with the following column headers:
 1. Process step
 2. Potential failure
 3. Potential failure effect
 4. SEV
 5. Potential cause of failure
 6. OCC
 7. Current monitor/control
 8. DET
 9. RPN
 10. Recommended changes/actions
 11. Who and When?
 12. Action completed

 13. SEV
 14. DET
 15. RPN
 Columns 1 through 
9 of the FMEA might be completed during the measure phase while columns 10 
through 15 are more appropriate for the improve phase. 
 Begin by identifying all possible process steps, activities, or inputs in column one. In column two, 
indicate what might go w
rong for each process step. Note that you can list process steps more than 
once if there are multiple opportunities for error within each step. If the team has created a detailed 
enough list of steps, however, this won™t likely be the case for a majority o
f the steps.
 In column three, enter a short description of the impact of the failure on the customer. Incorrect 
measurement can result in increased variance in a product, for example.  In the SEV column, rate the 
severity of the possible failure you descri
bed in the previous columns. Rate the severity from 1 to 10, 
with 1 being no effect, 5 being minor disruption to production, and 10 being severe enough to endanger 

a process or person. 
 In column five, enter the potential reasons the specific failure might
 occur, and in the OCC column, enter 
a numeric rating for how often the failure might be expected, with 1 being a very unlikely failure and 10 

being an almost inevitable failure.
 In column seven, create a short description of the current controls that are 
in place to monitor the 

process or prevent the failures the team has described. In the DET column, rate the ability of the process 
or staff to detect failure if it does occur. Rate detection between 1 and 10, with 1 being a process that 
includes automated 
detection that rarely fails and 10 being no detection at all. 
 Finally, calculate the risk priority number by multiplying the severity, occurrence, and detection ratings, 
as in the example below.
 A Six Sigma team working on a project to improve the speed w
ith which refunds are processed to 

customers is creating an FMEA. One row of the FMEA includes the following information:
  Process step: Refund request is entered in system.
  Potential failure: Incorrect amount is entered.
  Potential failure effect: The customer receives more or less refund than anticipated. 
  SEV: 8
  Potential cause of failure: Data
-entry employee transposes numbers or makes a similar typing 
mistake.
  OCC: 10
  Current monitor/control: A supervisor randomly revie
ws a sample of refund requests to ensure 
accuracy.
  DET: 7
  RPN: (SEV * OCC * DET) = (8*10*7) = 560
 The team completes a second row as follows:
  Process step: Refund check is printed.
 Page |

  Potential failure: The printed check has defects that make it difficult to 
cash.
  Potential failure effect: The customer can™t cash the check and has to call for a new one. 
  SEV: 9
  Potential cause of failure: Printer is misaligned or out of ink.
  OCC: 1
  Current monitor/control: The person who signs the checks reviews the checks as 
they sign them.
  DET: 2
  RPN: (SEV * OCC * DET) = (9*1*2) = 18
  The potential failure in the first example has a much higher risk priority number, which means, as the 
team moves forward, they are more likely to work on solving that potential failure. During 
analyze and 
improve phases, the team would recommend changes, implement the recommended actions, and 
rescore the process to determine if the RPN of the changed process is lower. If it is higher or the same, 
then the change was not a good one and the team m
ight need to try again.
 Collecting Data
 Creating a baseline metric for a process begins in the define phase, but teams cannot leave the measure 
phase without a strong understanding of current process performance. That understanding begins with 
figures such
 as sigma level, but teams should also define a process
-specific metric where possible and 
gather historical data regarding that metric so they have something to compare future data against to 
prove that improvements were made.
 Ideally, the team would have
 access to historical metrics for the process. In some cases, the team has to 
collect data from scratch. We™ll introduce data collection later in this chapter and cover it in depth in the 

units on sampling.  
 Continuous versus discrete data
 Before creating
 and displaying a baseline metric via graphical representation, you have to understand 
the type of data you are dealing with. Data is either discrete or continuous, and teams collect data 
either as a population sample or a process sample. How teams collect
 data and the type of data 
collected determine how the data can be viewed graphically and analyzed.
 Discrete Data
 Discrete data is categorical in nature; it is also referred to as qualitative data or attribute data. Discrete 
data falls into three categories: ordinal, nominal, and binary, or attribute, data; some data collected can 
be expressed in one or more of the di
screte categories. For example, student test scores can be 
conveyed in an ordinal fashion via the grades A, B, C, D, and F or in a binary fashion via the Pass/Fail 
distinction. 
 Discrete data can be displayed via Pareto charts, pie charts, and bar charts. 
In some instances, the data 
can be converted to run and control charts using variation within the data or ratios as the item being 

charted. In the chapter on the control phase, you™ll begin understanding why a team might want to 
convert discrete data to be
 used in a control chart.

 Within discrete data, binary or attribute data is usually the easiest data to collect. 
Attribute data records 
one o
f the other answers. 
Does the person choose paper or plastic? Is the room hot or cold? Is the glass 
empty or full?
 Is the light on or off? Depending on the scenario, attribute data can be very accurate. The 
light is either on or off; the switch position tells you that. Attribute data in this case can be automated 

with the right technology, which means it would be high
ly accurate. Whether the cup is empty or full is 
another story, because there are so many variations between completely empty and completely full. If 
the data is being collected by people, personal biases might enter the equation. Teams can remove 
some of 
those biases and better ensure accurate measurements, which will be covered in the sections 
on measurement systems. 
 Continuous Data
 Continuous data is quantitative data and is measured in units. For example, the time of day is measured 
in hours. Temperatu
re is measured in degrees, and almost anything can be converted to continuous 
data by making it a percentage.
 Continuous data is visualized in graphs such as histograms and box plots. Box plots are discussed in 

chapter 14, and histograms are covered in dep
th in the chapters on statistics. Continuous data can also 
be viewed in the form of run and control charts.
 Choosing Between Discrete and Continuous Data
 Sometimes, a process or activity can be measured in both discrete or continuous data. Depending on the
 purpose of the measurements, teams might need to pick between the two data types. For example, if a 
Six Sigma team has identified room temperature as an input into the quality of product, they will want 
to monitor the temperature of the room. They can do 
so by recording the temperature in degrees every 

ten minutes; that data would be continuous. Alternatively, the team might create a tick sheet, having 
someone make a mark every hour to note whether the temperature was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, or 80s 
with
 regard to the Fahrenheit scale. That data would be discrete.
 In this particular example, most teams would choose to record the continuous data. Exact temperature 
measurements every 10 minutes provides a lot more information than whether the temperature of
 the 
room was in the 70s at the turn of the hour. The continuous data could be converted to provide teams 
with the discrete data easily; the discrete data in this case 
Œ and in most cases 
Œ could not be converted 
to continuous data.
 What is true in the exa
mple is true for most scenarios. When possible, teams should convert 
measurements to continuous data. Continuous data:
  Provides more information than discrete data does.
  Is typically more 
time
-consuming to collect than discrete data unless teams have acces
s to 
automated or computerized data collection.
  Is more precise than discrete data.
  Lets teams remove variation and errors inherent in estimation and rounding.
  Levels of Data
 Data can be classified at four basic levels: nominal, ordinal, interval, and rat
io. Attribute, or binary, data 
is actually a limited form of nominal data. 
 Page |

 Nominal Data
 Nominal is considered to be the lowest data classification level and simply involves applying number 
labels to a qualitative description so statistical analysis progra
ms and tests can be applied to the data. 
The numbers assigned to each category don™t provide any information about whether the data is better 

or worse than other data in the listing 
Œ in nominal data, numbers don™t reflect a scale. 
 An example of nominal d
ata might be applied in a list of birth states for a classroom. In a class of 30, the 
number of students born in various states breaks down as follows:
  Texas:
 6  Louisiana: 4
  Arkansas: 10
  Mississippi: 1
  Oklahoma: 9
 In nominal data, each state would be provi
ded a numeric label:
 1. Texas
 2. Louisiana
 3. Arkansas
 4. Mississippi
 5. Oklahoma
 That doesn™t mean 5 students are from Oklahoma; it means 9 students fall into category 5 for the 
question ﬁWhat state were you born in?ﬂ
 For nominal data, central tendencies are calculated 
not with means or medians, but with mode. For 
example, a list of the nominal data in our example would be as follows:
 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5
 The mode is the number that appears most in the s
et; in this case, 3.
 Statistically, analysis is limited with regard to nominal data, but some tests can be performed with 
statistical analysis software.
 Ordinal Data
 Ordinal data is considered to be a higher form of data than nominal, though it still uses 
numbers and 
categories to identify data elements. With ordinal data, though, the numbers themselves actually 
provide some meaning. The numbers used in the FMEA scales at the beginning of this chapter were 

ordinal data. The numbers are qualitative in nature
, but they are also ranked. Central tendencies with 
ordinal data are measured by either the mode or the median, and common uses for this type of data 
include ranking various things against each other or rating a specific thing, such as a movie or pain leve
l. 
 Ordinal data can be arranged in an order that makes sense: 
on 
a 1 to 10 scale, Suzy rated the movies as 
2, 5, 6, and 9. If one is the worst and 10 is the best, then we can assume Suzy liked the last movie best.

 While ordinal data comes with a logical 
order, the intervals between the numbers don™t mean anything. 
If Suzy rated movie A as a 10 and movie B as a 9, the conclusion is that she liked movie A better. Exactly 
how much more she liked the movie is not discernible using ordinal data.  
 Interval Dat
a Interval data is an even higher form of data classification. Interval data provides numeric values that can 
be arranged in a logical order with meaning; the big difference between ordinal and interval data is that 
the difference between each interval val
ue provides meaning. If Frank is keeping track of the 
temperature in his house and he sees that at 8:00 a.m. it was 76 degrees and at 9:00 a.m. it was 80 
degrees, he not only knows that 9:00 a.m. was hotter
; he
 knows that it was 4 degrees hotter at 9:00 
a.m. than at 8:00 a.m. Interval data is continuous, or quantitative, and offers more flexibility when it 
comes to statistical analysis.  
 Ratio Data
 Ratio data is considered to be the highest of the data classifications. Ratio data has an absolute zero 
point
, can be both discrete or continuous in nature, and provides the highest capabilities for statistical 
analysis in many cases. Some examples of information that can be recorded using ratio data include 
force, defects per million opportunities, voltage, heig
ht, units per hour, and volume.
 Choosing the Best Measurement Systems
 Measurement systems analysis applies scientific principles to help teams analyze how much variation a 

system of measurement brings to a process. The purpose of the MSA is to identify err
ors of accuracy 
within data collection tools. Teams can then redress measurement systems to create more accurate 
data captures or, if that isn™t possible, take the possibility of errors into account when performing 
analysis on data.
 During measurement syst
ems analysis, teams should review multiple components of possible 
measurement error. Six Sigma teams analyze:
  Whether bias occurs in the accuracy of measurements
  Whether the measurement has the proper resolution
  What measurement scale linearity exists
  Whet
her measurement activities are stable over time
  Whether measurements are repeatable and reproducible
 Depending on the measurements the team is dealing with, the MSA can be time consuming and is often 
why the measure phase of a DMAIC project is one of the l
ongest.
 Creating Accuracy
 In this stage of MSA, teams define the difference between the most accurate measurement possible and 
the data being collected by the current measurement system. The goal of a measurement system is 
accuracy: coming as close as possible to a defined target, 
if not the exact measurement. For example, in 
a computer manufacturing plant, one employee might solder a chip to the motherboard. For the rest of 
the chips and wires to be added to the motherboard, the chip must be placed within a 2 mm area. In this 
case,
 a measurement tool might be implemented with a required accuracy of plus or minus 0.5 mm to 
ensure the chip is placed within the area targeted.

 Teams can ensure accuracy of data by verifying that the ga
uge used to collect data is performing 
accurately. I
f a digital scale is being used to weigh ingredients, teams should calibrate the scale using 
calibrated weights. If templates are used on a factory floor to make measurements more efficient, 
teams should ensure those templates are accurate by comparing the
m against known measurement 
tools such as verified rulers and scales. Note that, for the purpose of the MSA, accuracy reflects the 
performance of the measurement tool, not the operator. Whether the employee uses the measurement 
tool correctly or records th
e amount correctly is considered a concern of precision, which is covered 
later in this chapter under R&R 
Gages
. Once a Six Sigma team is confident that a measurement tool is properly calibrated, they can instruct 
employees or others who are responsible
 for recording data. Data should be accepted as it is collected 
for most efficient access and because early review can turn up specific problems with data collection. 
When possible, teams should not round data but collect it as it is recorded. 
 If data is 
being collected manually, employees should have a data collection template that prompts 
them to collect data at appropriate times and record information about the data collection event, 
including the person collecting the data, the machine or process invol
ved, conditions of the environment 
Œ especially those that are different from normal conditions or might have a direct impact on 
measurements 
Œ and the measurement tool being used if multiple tools are an option. These details 
help Six Sigma teams rule out
 outliers, which are discussed in the next chapter. 
 Before measurements are passed to the analyze phase, Six Sigma experts should review data to ensure 
there are no misplaced or missing decimal points, that duplicate entries haven™t been recorded, that 
frequency
-based measurements aren™t missing points, or that any other obvious issues haven™t occurred 
with the data. Addressing obvious data problems before beginning analyze phases reduces the chance 

that teams will come to false conclusions about root caus
es or viable solutions for a process.
 Addressing Resolution
 Measuring at the correct resolution ensures that a measurement system can detect change in the data 
or process appropriately. For example, if a Six Sigma team is working to improve a process that 
cuts pipe 
for bathroom fixture installations, it might be concerned with the length of the pipe. In reviewing the 

measurement system for the cut pipe, the team finds that the process includes measuring the pipe to 

the nearest centimeter. If, however, pipes
 that are off by several millimeters cause issues in the 
installation, then the nearest centimeter measurement is not a small enough resolution.
 A good rule of thumb to follow for resolution is called the 10
-bucket rule. Break your measurement 
resolution i
nto a tenth of what is required. If the pipe must measure within a range of 5 mm to perform, 
the measuring tool should measure to the ½ mm. In another example, a food service department might 
be tasked with maintaining the correct temperature in a freezer.
 To monitor the temperature, an 
employee records the temperature once per hour. If temperatures fluctuate quickly in the freezer, a 
change in temperature that would impact quality of food or ingredients might come and go between 
recordings. In this case, t
he proper resolution might be gained by recording measurements every 10 
minutes or every six minutes for 10 readings per hour. Even better, in a freezer with a digital thermostat 
connected to a network, teams might be able to access readings recorded every
 minute.
 Resolution is usually one of the easiest things to correct within a measuring system, but it isn™t always 
cost
-effective or plausible to measure at the most detailed resolutions. Teams should consider resource

 requirements when developing a measur
ement system. If, however, the most detailed resolution is 
possible, measurements obtained will provide more information about the process and a larger sample 
size from which to work.
 Adjusting for Errors of Linearity
 Linearity describes how a measurement 
system performs across a range. A standard metric ruler in the 
hands of most people is fairly accurate at measuring centimeters, but is less accurate at measuring 
millimeters or kilometers. A scale with a range between 0 and 10 kilograms might measure less
 accurately at either end of the range.
 Taking measurements at various ranges with an existing measurement system and comparing those 
measurements to data gathered with tools known to be accurate across all ranges can help teams find 
errors of linearity. I
n some cases, teams can develop mathematical equations to account for the 
discrepancies. For example, if the scale is accurate at 5 kilograms, but is off by an extra quarter of a 
kilogram for each kilogram thereafter, a measurement of 8.5 kilograms would a
ctually be:
 8.5 
Œ ((8.5
-5)*.25) = 7.625
 If mathematical adjustments are not possible, then teams should not use measurement systems to 
measure ranges where linearity errors regularly occur.
 Stability
 Stability describes the consistency of measurements over
 time. If operators are measuring in the same 
way and us
ing
 the same tools 
Œ and those tools don™t have any of the other problems described above 
Œ then 
measurements should reflect stability on a control chart. Control charts are introduced in Chapter 
16 and covered in depth in later chapters on statistical process control. 
 If the variation of measurements, as reflected on a control chart, do not indicate stability, then teams 
might want to first rule out a problem with the measurement system before determ
ining that the 
process is out of control.
 Gage
 R&R 
 Gage R&R tools are used to ensure repeatability and reproducibility with regard to measurement 
systems. In most cases, Gage R&R tools apply to measurement systems that involve human operators 
and appra
isers. Six Sigma teams apply Gage R&R tests to find weaknesses within such measurement 
systems. 
 In Gage R&R testing, repeatability means that a single employee, using the same measurement system 

and appraising the same things, can repeat his or her measur
ements. Reproducibility means that 
multiple employees using the same measurement system and appraising the same things come up with 

measurements that match or are very close to matching. 
 Most Gage R&R tests fall into two types: attribute and variable. The
 premise for testing each type of 
measurement is the same, though the criteria and statistical analysis following the test differ slightly.
 Attribute Gage R&R
 An attribute Gage R&
R is used when Six Sigma teams are analyzing measurement systems for go/no go 
data. For example, if operators review an item in the product line and decide simply to pass or fail it, this 
Page |

 would be an attribute measurement. In the example of the freezer mea
surements above, an employee 
might simply be tasked with recording whether the temperature was in an appropriate range: a yes/no 
measurement. As previously stated, attribute measurements provide the least information about a 
process, so in the case of the 
freezer temperature, it™s better to record the actual temperature. Whether 
that recording was within appropriate range can be determined systemically from the temperature data.
 When attribute data is used, an attribute Gage R&R is used to test the measurem
ent system following 
the steps below.
 1. Select at least two appraisers.
 2. Provide a number of samples. Label the samples in a way that you know which one is which but 

that wouldn™t identify the sample for the appraiser.
 3. Record the actual attribute measurement 
for each sample according to the best possible (most 
accurate) measurement you have.
 4. Have each appraiser record the attribute measurement for each sample provided (go/no go; 

yes/no; hot/cold; pass/fail; 
etc.
). 5. Repeat the process with the same samples an
d appraiser, randomizing the order in which you 
present the samples. Randomizing sample order the second time appraisers are presented with 
them reduces the chance that appraisers remember what measurement they recorded the first 
time and record the same m
easurement by default.
 6. Enter all data into a spreadsheet or Gage R&R file similar to the one below that shows a test of a 
pass/fail measurement.

 9 F F F F F Yes 10 P P P P P Yes  From the Gage R&
R above, you can see that the measurement system is reproducible only 50 percent of 
the time, making it a poor measurement system. It is repeatable 90 percent of the time for Appraiser 1

 and 80 percent of the time for Appraiser 2, and the appraisers are ac
curate 80 percent and 70 percent of 
the time respectively. Given these results, a Six Sigma team might determine that there is some problem 
of clarity with instructions for how to determine whether a sample is a pass or a fail. The chart above 
only provide
s data for a set of 10 samples; more accurate attribute Gage R&R testing usually requires at 
least 20 data points. 
 Variable Gage R&R
 Not all data is attribute data, which is why teams can also perform variable Gage R&R tests. While the 
raw data from a 
variable Gage R&R test can provide a Six Sigma team with a picture of whether a 
measurement system is obviously failing or not, statistical analysis is usually required to make a true 
determination about the performance of a measurement system. This is bec
ause, with variable 
measurements, some differences between measurements and operators is likely, particularly when 
measuring to very small or large figures or capturing data in a moving measurement.
 Set up a variable Gage R&R test in much the same way you 
set up an attribute test, using two to three 

appraisers and at least five to ten outputs to be measured. Have each appraiser measure each sample 

two or three times, randomizing the order in which samples are presented to avoid appraisers 

remembering the me
asurements initially entered. Record all data on a variable Gage R&R template, 
such as the example below.

 Teams should look to ensure all four elements of a variable Gage R&R test calculation are in what are 
considered ﬁsafeﬂ ranges. Commonly, each element comes with a scale for s
afe, or green, zones along 
with caution zones and failure zones. If one of the elements falls into a caution zone and all others into

 the green, then a team will likely conclude that the measurement system is sufficient. In some cases, all 
or a majority of
 caution zone scores might be deemed acceptable, particularly if making the 
measurement system any more accurate would be costly or cause application issues for other 
processes. Measurement systems that score in the failure zone for any element should prob
ably be 
repaired or replaced.
 Common criteria used to judge each element of the variable Gage R&R calculations are as follows:

   Note: Another tool that is effective in identifying variation in a measurement system is called the 
ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance. ANOVA is also useful for 
analyzing variation of any type, and will be 
covered in Unit 5 on intermediate statistics.
 Collecting Data
 Samples
 Once teams are sure the best possible measurement tools are in place, they can begin collecting data to 
be used in the analyze phase of the D
MAIC project. The most accurate conclusions come when a team 
can analyze data for the entire population, but that is rarely possible due to time and cost constraints. If 

you can gain access to automated data or data warehouses, you might be able to collect
 population data 
or extremely large sample sizes that better approximate population data. Otherwise, Six Sigma teams 

must randomly sample the population that is available and use those samples to draw conclusions about 

the population as a whole.
 To ensure 
samples can be used to draw statistical conclusions, they must be handled correctly and be 
the appropriate size. 
In this section, we™ll simply co
ver the types of sampling strategies that Six Sigma 
teams might use and why.
 Simple Random Sampling
 Simple random sampling works when there is an equal chance that any item within the population will 
be chosen. For example, if you put 20 marbles of the exa
ct size, weight, and texture in a bag and blindly 
select one, each marble in the bag has a 1 in 20 chance at being selected. If the marbles are different 
sizes or weights, those differing attributes can impact the chance that each marble will be selected. 
Heavier marbles might sort to the bottom of the bag; bigger marbles might be more likely to be picked 
up.
 Random sampling for statistical analysis requires that the sample will represent similar attributes and 

percentages as the entire population. The popu
lation is ﬁNﬂ items large. The sample size is ﬁnﬂ items 
large. How big the sample needs to be to statistically represent the population is decided by a number 
of factors

 Stratified Sampling
 Stratified sampling occurs when 
the population as a whole is divided or can be divided into subgroups 
with differing attributes. For example, if a shipping company wants to test the accuracy of its estimated 
shipping times against actual shipping times, it might assume that the results w
ill vary according to the 
distance a package has to travel. By randomly selecting samples from the entire package population, 
there™s a chance the company might only end up with samples for packages delivered within a 200
-mile 
radius. 
 To prevent bias in t
he data, the shipping company might divide the population into four subgroups: 
  Deliveries within 200
-mile radius
  Deliveries within 201 to 400
-mile radius
  Deliveries within 401 to 600
-mile radius
  Deliveries over 600 miles
 By sampling randomly from the stra
tified subgroups, the team ensures a sample size with less bias.
 Sequential Sampling
 Sequential sampling involves selecting every X item for inclusion in the sampling. Sequential sampling 

can be used when teams are collecting data at intervals such as time
. The team might collect data every 
10 minutes. Sequential sampling can also be used to sample physical items; every 5
th item on a product 
line might be reviewed. Given the right parameters and enough time, sequential sampling can provide 
valid statistical
 results. Teams must be cognizant, however, that the sequence of the sampling could, in 
rare cases, skew results. It is possible, for example, that something occurs during every 5
th iteration of a 
process that causes a difference to occur. 
 Samples that Ar
en™t Random
 Non
-random sampling should not be used when dealing with statistical analysis because it is more likely 
to introduce user or sampling error. While all sampling comes with some form of error, random 

sampling errors can be calculated and accounte
d for in analysis. The same cannot be said of non
-random 
samples.
 Non
-random sampling includes convenience or judgment sampling. Convenience sampling occurs when 
a team takes the most convenient measurements. ﬁWe want to know about the process right now, s
o 
let™s review the next dozen items that come off the line.ﬂ That type of analysis only truly tells the team 
how the process performed at that exact moment in time. 
 Judgment sampling occurs when an expert or knowledgeable person is tasked with ﬁselectingﬂ
 appropriate samples. A supervisor might say to his or her team members
, ﬁSelect some of your work 
that represents the normal way you function in a given day.ﬂ In most cases, the team members select 
what they believe is better quality work, skewing any res
ults from the sample. 
 Delivering a Baseline Metric
 One of the major deliverables coming out of define and measure phases is the baseline metric. How is 

the process performing now, and what measurement will the team use to compare current performance 
to po
st-improvement performance?

 Baseline metrics are numbers, but most teams find that presenting the metric graphically resonates best 
with business resources and executives. Visual representations also provide teams with a quick way to 
determine if progress 
is occurring.
 The type of visual representation you use depends on whether your major metric is discrete or 
continuous. Discrete data can be displayed on Pareto charts (see Chapter 5) and continuous data can be 
displayed via run charts. You can also use va
riation or other calculations to convert discrete data to 
continuous data for display in run charts and control charts (see Chapter 16 for information about 
control charts). 
 Run Charts
 A run chart can be used to monitor the performance of any variable or 
process over time. With a single, 

intuitive chart, Six Sigma teams can display trends, shifts, and cycles within a process; they can also 

monitor a process for concerns, though run charts are not as effective at this as the very similar control 
chart is.
 A basic run chart is simply a line plot of the data over time, which means anyone can create the chart. 
Most Six Sigma run charts also feature a line representing the median of all data points for visual 
reference. Depending on the type of information being
 charted, you may need to convert data to a ratio 
for a more accurate run chart. For example, if you are plotting the temperature of a surface over time, 
there is no need to convert data. If you are plotting the number of patients readmitted to a hospital 
within 30 days of being discharged, then it helps to convert the data to a percentage of the number of 
patients discharged within the same time period. In a 30
-day period where 10,000 patients were 
discharged, you can expect a higher number of returns than
 a period during which only 5,000 patients 
are discharged.
 The figure below illustrates a run chart of temperature over time. You can see how temperature 

changes through time and begin to see some possible trends. A Six Sigma team would be able to zoom 

out
, viewing the run chart over more time to validate trend assumptions. You can also see that the 
median temperature for the process is 33.

   The run chart below indicates the number of returns per hundred sales for each month of the year. You 
can see that
 returns as a rate of sales increases steadily during the first part of the year before holding 
steady from May through November. The orange line indicates the median returns per hundreds sales, 

which is just under 7.
    Create Basic Run Charts in Excel
 Statistical analysis software, including Minitab and Excel SPC, creates all elements of a run chart 
automatically from entered data, but anyone can use basic Excel functions to create a run chart if 
needed.
 First, create a data table.
 Creating a data table 
for a single attribute, such as temperature, just requires entering the time labels in 
one column and the attribute measurements in another. For the example, we™ll walk through creating a 

rate data table, since it involves additional steps.
 1. Enter the data 
labels (month, week, hour, etc
.) in the first column of Excel. 
 2. In the next column, enter the corresponding measurements for the attribute you are interested 

in: in this case, the total number of returns per month.
 3. In the third column, enter the total numb
er of items you are comparing the attribute to
: in this 
case, the total number of sales per month.

  4.  In the fourth column, calculate the percentage the first column of data is of the second. In this 
case, the percentage of returns per sales for each month
. The calculation is achieved in this case 
by the formula =B2/C2 for January, =B3/C3 for February, and so forth.
   5. Decide whether you want to create a run chart showing percentages, or if you would like to 
create the chart illustrating rate per 100, per 1
,000, etc. 
 6. If you want to illustrate a rate per (x), 
multiply 
the percentage calculation in the fourth column 
by (x). In this case, the figures in column D are multiplied by 100.

   7. Use Excel to calculate the median of the number you plan to chart. The me
dian is calculated 
with the formula =Median(Number 1, Number 2,–), where the numbers in the formula correlate 

with the range of all the charted data points. In this case, the median is 6.96679
 8. Highlight the data labels (in this case, column A) and the figu
res to be charted (column E)

   11. Draw a line on your run chart approximately where the median would be. Use Excel 
tools to 
select a color and thickness for the line that you desire.

 The completed run chart can be used to present information to the Six Sigma team or include a 
graphical representation of baseline process performance in a measure phase tollgate present
ation. 
Again, it should be noted that manual creation of a run chart is not required for most Black Belts and 
Green Belts, who will have access to statistical analysis software.
 Measure Tollgate Checklist
 Use the checklist below to determine whether a team
 is ready to move from the measure phase to the 
analyze phase of a DMAIC project.
 o The team has agreed upon the key measurements and come up with a baseline measurement of 
process performance.
 o The team has analyzed measurement systems and identified any iss
ues that might contribute to 
analysis errors.
 o Where possible, the team has corrected measurement systems to remove error risks.
 o The team has calculated process variation and sigma level.
 o The team has conducted appropriate sampling to allow for statisticall
y valid conclusions in the 
next phase.
 o The sponsor or champion has reviewed and signed off on all elements of the measure phase.

 Chapter 14: Analyze 
  If the chapter on the measure phase seemed especially long, it™s because the phase itself is long and
 requires a great deal of work. Without a strong measure phase, the team cannot move on to analyze 
data and make data
-based decisions that drive improve and control phases. Analyze phases also require 
a lot of work, but that work is usually performed by Bl
ack Belts and Green Belts, who report findings to 
the Six Sigma team and ask for feedback about analysis and verification of analysis. 
 In this chapter, we™ll discuss a number of tools that might be used by Six Sigma teams during the analyze 
phase, but we™
ll also reference other chapter
s and units. Units 4, 5, 7 and 8 provide in
-depth information 
about the statistical tools referenced throughout this chapter.
 Root Cause Analysis
 One of the fundamental activities of the analyze phase performed by the entire 
team with help from 
identified subject matter experts is the root cause analysis. Root cause analysis is used to identify root 
causes for problems or defects when a team has reached the analyze phase without a clear idea of 
primary causation. Some of the t
ools described for identifying root causes in this chapter could be used 
in either define or measure phases at the discretion of the Black Belt leading the team; the FEMA 
described in Chapter 13 on measure could likewise be used in the analyze phase as par
t of root cause 
analysis.
 The Cause and Effect, or Fishbone, Diagram
 A popular method for brainstorming and analyzing causation in a process is the fishbone diagram. The 
fishbone diagram can be completed by a single Six Sigma expert, but it typically has 
more value when it 
is completed by the entire Six Sigma team. The diagram lets teams concentrate on a brainstorming 
process that generates ideas about possible problem causes, organizes those possibilities in a logical 
way, and lets teams visualize the inf
ormation to identify priorities, trends, and relationships between 
ideas. When used as a team activity, the fishbone diagram encourages participation and input from all 

team members, which increases the chance of laying the foundational work for a viable a
nd original 

solution.
 The cause and effect diagram is called the fishbone diagram because you begin with what looks like a 

simple drawing of a fish skeleton. Reference the diagram below and follow the instructions to create a 
fishbone diagram as part of a 
team brainstorming exercise. You can also use these instructions now to 
practice a fishbone diagram based on a process or problem you have experience with.

  1. Sketch a basic fishbone shape on a whiteboard or large flipchart. Write a summarized version of 
the problem where the fish head should be. Note: You don™t have to conduct a fishbone diagram 
only on the problem statement from the define phase. Teams might also conduct the diagram 
on a specific defect or issue found during the define or measure phase. Fo
r example, if the 
problem statement discusses the amount of waste in a restaurant, the team might have 
discovered during the measure phase that bread is being thrown away at a rate higher than all 

other food items. One of the activities handled in the anal
yze phase might be a fishbone 
diagram specifically about the reason for so much bread waste.
 2. Draw a fish spine and four major connectors. Label each connector as People, Process, 
Materials, and Procedure. Some Black Belts also include two other major conne
ctors: Equipment 
and Environment. 
 3. Explain the categories of the fishbone diagram to the team. Note that there are some places, 
especially with particular processes, where the various categories will overlap. Some ideas 
generated by the team as they comple
te the fishbone diagram might fit in more than one 

category, and that™s okay.
 a. People references anyone who carries out or interacts with a process.
 b.
 Process or machine refers to the process by which inputs become outputs.
 c. Procedure or method refers to the w
ay things are done, whether by written documents 

or unwritten rules.
 d.
 Materials are the inputs, such as raw goods, into the process.
 e. Equipment includes the technology or machines required to handle the work.
 f. Environment is the immediate area surrounding the
 process.
 4. Begin with each category on the fishbone diagram, asking the team how something in that 
category might be responsible for a problem or defect. 
 5. Use sticky notes to write down ideas and place them on the fishbone diagram so you can move 

ideas arou
nd later. You can also write directly on the diagram.
 6. Couple cause
-and
-effect brainstorming with the 5 Whys exercise described in Chapter 6. For 
each branch of the fishbone diagram, ask ﬁWhy?ﬂ at least five times to ensure the most granular 
detail possible
. 7. Once the team has run out of ideas for the first category, repeat steps 4 through 6 for all other 
categories.

 8. Take some time as a team to review the diagram, discussing the placement of potential causes, 
and moving them to appropriate categories and subs
ections to create an organized visual 
representation.
 9. Remove or cross
-out causes that don™t prove to be valid after initial discussion.
 10. As a team, decide which root causes seem most likely or highest priority. Circle those causes as 
high
-priority possibili
ties for further investigation.
  Cause and Effect Brainstorm Example
 To provide a better idea of how a fishbone diagram works, consider the example image below and we™ll 
walk through how the team came up with the information recorded on the procedure/metho
d line of 
this diagram.
  The team above was working to solve a problem of burnt cakes in a food
-service bakery. When 
discussing the method by which the cakes are being baked, the team first came up the with 
the 
reason 
that the cakes were being baked at in
consistent times. Perhaps, suggested one team member, staff 
weren™t paying attention and were leaving cakes in the oven too long. The idea was written down.
 The instructions for baking cakes are vague, said another team member 
Œ this time, a subject matter
 expert from the bakery. ﬁWhy?ﬂ asked the team. The subject matter expert responded that the 
instructions in the bakery don™t take various types of cakes into account, leaving staff guessing about 
bake times for some cakes. Further ﬁWhy?ﬂ questions helped 
the team determine that new cakes were 
added to the menu without the overall instructions for bakery staff being updated.
 After digging deeper into the inconsistent baking times, the team again asked themselves how methods 
could be responsible for burnt ca
kes. Someone suggested that the temperature in the oven was too hot, 
and the team tied that suggestion to the same root cause as the inconsistent bake times. Upon final 
review, someone noted that the suggestion that staff not paying attention was a cause w
asn™t valid, 
because the bakery was equipped with alarms that sounded when baking time was done. The team 
crossed that idea off the diagram.
 In this case, the Six Sigma team might prioritize the fact that instructions are not available for all types of 
items being prepared in the bakery. Because this would likely be a simple and common
-sense 
improvement to make, the Black Belt might even assign
 someone to begin working on the improve

 phase as soon as the cause was verified. Many times, the root cause is not as obvious and the solution 
for the cause even less obvious, requiring addition
al analysis and validation before moving forward.
 Root Cause 
Verification Matrix
 Once teams identify possible root causes, they must verify that the causes are valid. Root cause 

verification can be completed via a variety of methods, including statistical analysis, design of 
experiments, logical questioning, observi
ng a process, gathering additional data, analyzing data via 
graphical representation, and mapping processes at a more granular level than accomplished in the 
define phase. While this chapter touches briefly on statistical analysis and graphical representat
ion, 
those topics, as well as experiments and process mapping, are covered in later units.
 Whatever method is used to validate root cause assumptions, the Six Sigma team should document it. 

Documentation regarding root cause verification is usually complet
ed on a matrix that includes the 
problem, possible root causes, the verification method, why the verification method was chosen, results 
of the verification, and, in some cases, whether a senior Six Sigma leader, such as a Master Black Belt, 
agrees. A temp
late for such a matrix is included below, but teams can also create similar documents in 
Excel or Word.

 Six Sigma experts and teams can use a variety of graphical analysis tools to help generate ideas abou
t root causes or understand how inputs and outputs really impact each other. Some of those graphical 

analysis tools require statistical analysis software, and those will be covered in later chapters. In this 
section, we™ll look at a few graphical represent
ations you can create easily with Excel.
 Pareto Chart
 The first graphical tool for validating root causes is the Pareto chart, which was covered in chapter 5. 
Chapter 5 discussed the Pareto Principle, or 80/20 rule, which says that 20 percent of the causes
 lead to 
80 percent of the results. Because of this, a Pareto chart is a good starting point for root cause 
brainstorming 
Œ teams can start with the few inputs or attributes accounting for the bulk of the Pareto 
chart. Just as you can ﬁdrill downﬂ using th
e fishbone diagram, asking deeper and deeper ﬁWhy?ﬂ 
questions, you can drill down using a Pareto chart.
 Consider the Pareto chart illustrating reasons for medical claims denials from Chapter 5.

   In this case, the team might decide to concentrate on the top two claims denial reasons: 
duplicate 
claim 
and timely filing. The team could use various methods for digging deeper into root causes for these two 
claims denial reasons. They might perform a fis
hbone diagram to discover why duplicate claims are 
being generated. To understand the timely filing problem, teams might gather additional data for 
graphical analysis.
 Timely filing means that the claim was not originally filed with an insurance company pr
ior to the 
deadline for claims submission. Different insurance companies have various timely filing requirements, 
and the countdown usually starts at the time of service to the patient or the time of discharge from a 
facility. The team might want to unders
tand which payers are denying claims for timely filing, so they 
collect data as follows on how many timely filing denials are associated with each payer. Because Pareto 

analysis is concerned with the top few, you can lump the many others together in a sing
le entry and, for 
the purposes of the Pareto analysis, ignore them. A medical provider might bill claims to dozens of 

providers; including every provider on the data table and Pareto chart would be a waste of both time 

and space for this particular exercis
e.

   Converted to a basic Pareto chart, the data is illustrated in the graph below.
  It™s easy to see from the graph that the bulk of the problem is with payers A and
 B; perhaps these 
companies have shorter timely filing guidelines than the other companies or billing staff is unaware of 
the proper timely filing requirements for those payers. Six Sigma teams can begin asking questions 

specific to these payers as they co
ntinue analyzing data and discovering root causes.
 Box Plots
 Box plots are another graphical representation that can be handled with Excel. In later chapters on 
statistical analysis, we™ll cover how box plots can be related to hypothesis testing and other 
analysis. 
When differences between distributions are marked, however, or when outliers are fairly obvious within 
data, the image of a box plot tells its own story without requiring advanced statistical knowledge.
 Box plots are often called Box
-and
-Whisker 
graphs. To understand how to read a box plot, consider the 
data table and graph below. The data table shows the time in minutes in which various runners 
completed a one
-mile race. The results are divided into the categories Children and Adults.

 29 15   The above image shows a box plot of the data table, generated in Excel. 
Even without further 
explanation, you can likely tell that the children completed the race on average slower than the adults. 
The blue box, which represents the children, is shorter than the orange box, indicating that the middle 

50 percent of children com
pleted the mile
-long run in times that had less variation than that of the 
middle 50 percent of adults. To understand how this conclusion was arrived at, we™ll take a look at all 
the elements of a box plot.
 A box plot begins with the upper and lower hinge 
Œ the top and bottom of the box. The top represents 
the 75
th percentile; the bottom represents the 25
th percentile of the data. The line within the box 
represents the 50
th percentile. Within the box are the 50 percent of data points between the 25
th and 
75th percentiles. 
 Each box plot receives upper and lower whiskers indicating the range of most of the other data within a 
set. In this case, Excel creates whiskers that extend to the top and bottom of a range barring any

 statistical outliers. Some statistic
al analysis software or methodologies use other methods to create the 
whiskers with very similar results.
 Finally, since all plot points must be represented on a box plot graph, outliers are indicated with dots. 
You™ll see a blue dot above the children™s b
ox, representing the data point of 29 minutes. That 
particular
 point is a statistical outlier; Six Sigma teams who note outliers on box plots should consider the data that 
is shown as an outlier. If an explanation can be found for the outlier, i
t can be ignored. For example, if 
the child who took 29 minutes to complete the mile was much younger than the other children or was 
walking with an injury, the data point is explained and can be excluded from further analysis.
 In addition to calling out o
utliers, box plots let you compare two distributions graphically to see if, as in 
the above example, there are obvious differences between the data sets. Box plots are useful in 

comparing how various attributes impact a process. Six Sigma teams might compa
re process results for 
different operators, different times of day, different teams, or using different inputs. It™s important 
when comparing data in this fashion to only alter one attribute or input
; otherwise, you won™t be able to 
tell what 
 the cause
 of any difference between data sets
 was
 if a statistical difference does seem likely 
on a box plot.
 Use some information for a work process you are familiar with, or use the sample data provided, to 
create box plots in Excel following the steps provided b
elow.
 A department manager believes that the staff on her teams would be more productive if they were able 
to work with two computer monitors. Because outfitting an entire department with dual monitors 
would be costly, the manager™s boss requires some proo
f that her assumption is correct. The manager 
equips a few stations with dual monitors and lets different team members work at the stations. She 
records the amount of work done within hourly increments at stations that have dual monitors as well 
as station
s that have single monitors. Her data is featured in the table below.

   While a Six Sigma Black Belt would be able to back up the conclusion with hypothesis testing or other 
analytics, the manager might get her request for monitors approved with nothing more than this box 

plot. It™s easy to see that the second monitor 
did
 incr
ease production capability for staff. Another thing 
worth noting is that the distributions for each of the boxes and whiskers is similar, which is somewhat 
expected. High producers are still going to produce the most, and low producers are still going to 
produce less than high produces, even if everyone is producing slightly more with the new 
set
-up.
 Note that the two examples used in this chapter used data sets that were different enough to be visually 

noticeable on a box plot. This isn™t always the case, 
which is why box plots and other graphical 
representations are often only the starting point for analysis.
  Statistical
 Analysis
 Because statistical analysis is covered in several future units, this section lists some common statistical 
analysis tools with definitions
. Hypothesis Testing
 Hypothesis testing 
lets Six Sigma experts draw conclusions about the population based on statistical 
analysis performed on a sample. Because the conclusions are based on samples and not the entire 
population, there is always some risk of error. You might have seen or heard p
oll results given with a 
plus/minus in the result: ﬁ60 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points, would vote for the candidate 
today.ﬂ That plus/minus is the value for the error risk.
 In statistical analysis, the risk that a sample doesn™t offer a good re
presentation of the population is 
known as the alpha
-risk and the beta
-risk. Using information about the sample and alpha and beta risks,

 statisticians calculate what is called the p
-value. The p
-value is a probability estimate that tells 
statisticians how
 likely an assumption or conclusion drawn on sample data will be incorrect.
 Statistical software removes a lot of the manual calculations from the process of setting up and running 
hypothesis tests. With Minitab, for example, Six Sigma experts can conduct 
hypothesis tests on prepared 

data with a few mouse clicks. They do have to know which types of hypothesis tests to use in which 
situations. 
 Correlation and Regression Analysis
 Regression and correlation analysis help
s Six Sigma experts understand how variables within a process 
might be related. Regression analysis helps teams define the relationship between one independent 
va
riable 
Œ possibly an input 
Œ and one dependent variable 
Œ possibly an output. Does the temperature in 
the oven have a relationship to whether the cake is baked correctly, and how close are the two things 
related? Does the number of hours a person works hav
e an impact on his or her productivity 
Œ can the 
team show a correlation between lower production as employees approach the end of a shift? These 

are the type
s of questions that regression analysis can answer.
 To work with regression analysis, both of the 
variables being studied have to be in numerical format. To 

conduct a regression analysis regarding the relationship between oven temperature and whether a cake 

is baked correctly, a Six Sigma team baked cakes at varying temperatures and rated them numerica
lly on 
ﬁdoneness.ﬂ A rating of 1 indicated the cake hardly cooked at all; a rating of 5 indicated a perfectly 
baked cake. At 10, the cake was completely burned. The temperatures and corresponding ratings are 
seen in the data table below.

  Just looking at this graph, you can tell that a relationship does exist. The data plots are gathered tightly 
around the trend line, which indicates that as temperature rises so does the doneness of the cake. 
 Design of Experiments
 Correlation and regression analysis doesn™t always provide the information a team needs to determine 
relationships between variables, especially when those re
lationships are complex
, or multiple variables 
are present. Because the analyze phase sets the stage for the improve phase, teams have to be as 
certain as possible in their analytical conclusions before they decide on solutions for implementation. A 
design
 of experiments can provide the more granular details and analysis required for that level of 
certainty. 
 Design of experiments, or DoE, is performed via statistical analysis software such as Minitab. Teams can 

set up experiments for one factor or multiple
 factors.

 Chapter 15: Improve
   During the improve phase of a DMAIC project, Six Sigma teams brainstorm possible solutions for the 
root causes identified in the analyze phase and rank those solutions according to costs, how effective 
the solution would be, and h
ow likely the solution could be implemented. Analytical rankings are used 
to prioritize and select solutions for implementation. Teams pilot solutions through beta tests or small 
roll outs, collect data on the solution, and verify that the solution is work
ing as expected via statistical 
analysis. Once the team is confident that the solution works to address the problem, it plans and 
implements a full rollout of the solution.
 Solutions Selection Matrix
  A solutions selection matrix is an analytical tool that
 lets teams propose and rank solutions for any of the 
root causes identified in the analyze phase. While teams can work simultaneously on multiple solutions 
if multiple prioritized root causes were found, Black Belt and other team leaders must remain cogni
zant 
of timelines, resources, scope, and the purpose of the project. If a single solution provides enough 
positive impact to reach project goals, then other solutions might be saved for future improvement 

projects. If one solution would reach results, but 
another solution would be especially easy to 
implement and provide additional positive results, the team is likely to decide to implement both.
 A solutions selection matrix can be created in Excel, and teams should work on the document together 
in a brains
torming capacity. It™s a good idea to include the entire team as well as relevant subject matter 
experts and stakeholders during solutions brainstorming. This ensures the solutions the team comes up 
with are more likely to be a realistic fit for the proces
s and business; once solutions are selected using 
the matrix, teams will also likely have to get sponsor, champion, or leadership council support before a 
partial or full implementation is possible. This is especially true where solutions require expenditu
re or 
will impact processes and people outside of the project™s scope.
 An example solutions selection matrix is pictured below.
  The matrix is completed by:
 1. Entering the problem statement in the first column. This should be the final problem statement 

that was arrived at during the measure phase if the team decided that the statement should be

171

 altered after gathering data. Otherwise, this can be the problem st
atement from the define 
phase.
 2. Entering a priority validated root cause from the analyze phase. If the team is going to attempt 
to solve more than one root cause during the improve phase, it should create a solutions 
selection matrix for each root cause.
 3. Brainstorming potential solutions in column three. During the brainstorming process, teams 
should not question or attempt to analyze solutions, but should record any solution suggested 
that seems at all viable. The only solutions that might be ignored are t
hose that are clearly out 
of scope or impossible, but the Black Belt leading the brainstorming exercise will have to use his 
or her own discernment about such suggestions.
 4. Noting, at a very high level, the practical methods by which a solution could be imp
lemented. In 
one example used in the analyze chapter, a commercial bakery had a problem that was caused 

by lack of baking instructions. In this case, the Six Sigma team might propose that staff be 
provided with proper instructions. The method by which that
 solution occurs is written 
documentation and training. 
 5. Rating solutions. After a list of possible solutions and practical methods is created, the team 
rates each possibility on effectiveness, feasibility, and cost
-benefit. Each category is given a 
rating
 between 1 and 10.
 a. Effectiveness is the measure of how well a solution will eliminate a root cause for a 
problem, with 1 being not effective and 10 being highly effective.
 b.
 Feasibility is the measure of effort required to implement the improvement, with 1 
being not feasible because of the effort or resources required and 10 being highly 
feasible. 
 c. Cost
-benefit is an estimated measure of how the costs of a project compare to the 
savings expected. This rating is not a formal cost benefit analysis, but is a hig
h-level 
estimation. If savings are expected to outweigh the costs associated with a project, the 
team ranks the solution as high. Otherwise, the team ranks the solution low.
 6. The scores for effectiveness, feasibility, and cost
-benefit are multiplied to calc
ulate an overall 
score. The overall score can be used to prioritize solutions and select the solution that features 
the best overall effectiveness, feasibility, and cost
-benefit rating.
   Consider a possible solutions selection matrix created regarding the
 medical claims denial example used 
in the analyze chapter. 
 Page | 
172

8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
   During the analyze chapter, a Pareto analysis indicated that timely filing issues were a root cause for 
high claims denials. In the solutions selection matrix above, a team has identified and 
prioritized four 
possible solutions after discovering that claims were not filed 
on time 
because claims billing staff didn™t 
have all the proper information in time.
 The first solution is to require the front desk to collect as much information as possible
. The team gave 
this solution a mid
-range rating for effectiveness because it doesn™t address the fact that clinical 
information can still be missing from the claim. But, the process would be effective at gathering 
demographic information and would not req
uire large expense or effort to implement, so the team 
rated it high for the other categories.
 Next, the team considered creating and requiring a patient email or portal system so billing staff could 

communicate quickly with patients when information was m
issing. Because not all patients have email 
and many would be unlikely to use such a system, the team ranked this solution as low for feasibility and 
effectiveness.
 The third solution considered by the team was requiring clinicians to include all informati
on necessary 
for billing as they charted during the visit with the patient. The team thought this solution would be 
fairly effective, but that clinicians would be unlikely to take the time to be so thorough when dealing 
with patient issues. The solution mi
ght also slow physician visits, resulting in a negative impact to 
revenue.
 Finally, the team considered a solution that put certain staff members in charge of claims with missing 
information. Because those staff members could concentrate on missing claims 
and would work through 
a new workflow built by the team, they would be more likely to file claims on time. Overall, the team

 ranked this solution highest, but they decided to implement both solutions one and four because 
solution one required so little eff
ort and would actually help drive the success of solution four.
 Cost Benefit Analysis
 When teams include the appropriate individuals in the process, a solutions selection matrix is very adept 
at identifying the best possible solutions for implementation. L
eadership councils and executive 
sponsors often want more information about the costs and benefits expected for a solution, though, so 
teams should be prepared to create a cost benefit analysis. Black Belts often have many of the elements 

required for such
 an analysis after the measure and analyze phases, but teams might also need to work 
with accounting, finance, or business planning departments to gain accurate financial details required.
 The goal of a cost benefits analysis is to compare the costs of imp
lementing a solution with the 
monetary benefits expected from the solution. Costs include expenses such as software development or 

purchase, equipment purchase, building development or renovation, additional labor or hiring, training 
expenses, additional s
upplies, and any losses associated with disruption as the solution is implemented. 
Benefits might include an increase in product margin, increase in revenue, cost savings or avoidance, 
and intangible benefits such as increase to staff morale or customer re
tention.
 Six Sigma teams usually aren™t in a position to handle detailed cost benefit analysis such as might be 

completed by a certified accountant, but they can create an idea of cost benefit relationships via the 
payback method of analysis. This is the s
implest way to approach such an analysis and provides 
leadership with an estimated time before a project ﬁpays off.ﬂ 
 Payback, or Pay Off, Analysis
 To conduct a payback analysis, Six Sigma teams must have an estimated cost for the project as well as 
the es
timated financial benefit per year. Remember, financial benefits don™t just include increases in 
revenue. Cost savings, new customers, or mitigation of customer loss can all be considered as 
contributing to benefits each year. The team also needs to unders
tand the estimated operating costs of 
an improvement for each year.
 The formula for this analysis is:
 (Cost of implementing solution) / (Annual financial benefits 
Œ annual costs)
 If a project costs $50,000 to implement and $2,000 per year in extra labor, 
and the team expects the 
project to generate $15,000 in financial benefits each year, then the calculation is:
 $50,000 / ($15,000 
- $2,000)
 $50,000/$13,000
 Or, approximately 3.84 years until the project pays for itself. 
 Obviously, organizational leaders a
re looking for payback calculations that are as short as possible, but if 
the solution will solve a major problem or set a foundation for extraordinary success in the future, a 
longer payback time doesn™t necessarily keep a solution off the table.

 Net Pres
ent Value
 A more concise way of calculating cost benefits is known as the Net Present Value, or NPV. NPV adjusts 
benefits and costs as time passes because cash flow in the future is not as valuable as current cash flow 
due to inflation and other economic f
actors. The discount rate for various endeavors can be calculated 
using expected return, interest rates, or inflation rates. Often, corporate finance departments can 

provide Six Sigma teams with a discount rate used for NPV in the company. A very basic NPV
 model is 
shown below.
  This year

 $25,650

  In this model, the team spent $50,000 implementing a solution and expects a $2,000 labor expense 
associated with the solution each year. The estimated benefits from the solution are recorded for the 
first two years, and all of the benefits and costs are ad
ded up for a third
-year view. The NPV is 
discounted by 5 percent, and the final number is seen in the bottom right cell: $2,850. The goal is a 
positive NPV, so this project fits that goal. 
 Piloting a Solution
 Once a solution is selected and work done to bring it into production at a minimal level, the Six Sigma 

team is ready for a pilot. A pilot is a limited trial of a solution in a live environment. No matter how much 
analysis was completed or how well test ca
ses were run, teams can™t know for certain how a solution

 will behave in the ﬁwild.ﬂ The live production environment will always have variables that teams can™t 
account for, particularly when people are involved in the process.
 Benefits of a limited pilot 
include:
  Use of resources are limited, which reduces waste if the solution turns out to be incorrect or 
not effective in resolving the problem
  Confirmation that expected results occur 
  Allows troubleshooting of a new solution on a smaller scale to minimize
 disruption during full 
transition
  Lets employees outside of the Six Sigma team provide feedback on the solution and 
implementation to make the final rollout more successful
 Teams don™t have to pilot every change they make. Simple or small changes can be m
ade without 
piloting as long as teams document the changes well and measure results for verification. When changes 
are large in scope, could cause expensive or expansive consequences, or would be difficult to reverse, 
teams should begin with a pilot. The s
ame is true for any solution that might be expensive to implement 
at a full scale.
 Pilots can occur on a limited scale or for a limited time. Limited scale pilots incorporate a specific region, 

team, group of people, or machinery. Limited time pilots imple
ment a temporary change; at the end of a 
scheduled time, the team makes a decision about whether the change should be made permanent. 
 Pilots can occur with either processes or products. Process pilots might feature testing specific locations, 
testing resu
lts with some customers, working with some employees to test new processes, or 
conducting dry runs of a process without impact to the end
-user. Product pilots are conducted using test 
markets, product models, or alpha and beta testing of the product with c
ertain end
-users.
 To create a pilot, a Six Sigma team must first select the audience for the pilot. Internal process pilots can 
be performed by a select team or a select few employees. External product pilots can be performed 
using a subset of customers. F
or the best pilot results, avoid biasing results by selecting the best possible 
performers or customers who are most likely to work hard to ensure a product succeeds. When the 
solution is implemented on a full scale, it will be used by everyone, so you wan
t to ensure it works for 
everyone.
 When possible, pilot at a very small level and then expand the pilot to a larger audience. This is the 
premise behind alpha and beta testing. A very small set of loyal customers tests the product first, 
because you know t
hey will provide feedback. Next, an expanded set of customers tests the product 
after teams have made changes associated with feedback from the first group of users. Finally, if the 
limited tests are successful, teams choose to roll 
out 
the product to the 
entire audience.
 Analyze Pilot and Test Results
 Six Sigma experts can use all the tools associated with the analyze phase to test whether solutions have 
a positive impact during testing or pilot programs. Hypothesis testing can be used to compare data from
 before the solution to data after the solution, determining if there is a statistically significant and 

positive change. Graphical analysis can be very helpful in demonstrating for executive leaders how a 
solution has positively impacted a problem by redu
cing defects, improving production or efficiency, or 
reducing costs.

 Planning Implementation
 Once solutions have been verified through tests and analysis, teams can begin the work of implementing 
changes on a large scale. Teams should create and work from 
an action plan during this vital and active 
stage of the DMAIC process to ensure that no plans or requirements fall through the cracks. During the 
active part of the improve phase, the project leader will likely delegate numerous activities to members 

of t
he team, and the team will also rely on input and assistance from those outside of the Six Sigma 
team. Keeping an action plan document helps everyone on the team see where they are in the process, 
what they are responsible for, and what date work must be c
ompleted by.
 If the Six Sigma team is working with a project manager, he or she is likely responsible for action plan 

documentation and follow
-up. Teams can also use a basic spreadsheet or Word document, which should 
be saved in a common location, to keep 
track of what work is to be done and who will do it.
 Because every project is unique, improve action plans are also unique. Most action plans will contain 
common tasks such as documentation, training, and transition.
 Documentation
 First, the Six Sigma team
 should have documented all of its work so far during the DMAIC process. If 
asked, the Black Belt or designated team member should be able to present analysis in the form of data 
tables, statistical calculations and explanations, and graphical analysis. Al
l brainstorming activities and 

diagrams should be saved in a central file location where all team members can view them and 
appropriate team members can edit them as needed. Access to these documents helps team members 
work efficiently on additional docume
ntation required for implementation.
 Almost any organization will require new processes or changes to processes to be recorded in standard 
operating procedures. Depending on the organizational structure of a business, Six Sigma teams might 
be responsible f
or drafting such documents or they might need to work with knowledge management 
resources to create SOPs in keeping with corporate branding and templates. Teams might also create 
general communications letting other staff members know about the upcoming ch
anges and the 
reasons for those changes as well as general reference documents such as cheat sheets and Frequently 
Asked Questions.
 Training
 Strong documentation is key to the next part of implementing improvements, which is staff training. Six 

Sigma teams
 usually aren™t in charge of complete staff training on any improvement they make. Instead, 
teams begin the training process by working with training subject matter experts or delegates in the 
department impacted by the upcoming changes. The Six Sigma team
 trains these individuals, who then 
go on to train other individuals who will be impacted by the process. At some point, the process training 
should be integrated into regular organizational training by trainers or knowledge management 
departments.
 Transit
ion
 During the improve phase of a DMAIC project, teams should begin to consider the need to transition a 

process back to the business and traditional process owner. Transition is part of the control phase, but 
teams should move from improve to control with
 a good understanding of how the process should be

 measured and monitored. Strong documentation and training during the improve phase helps cement 
the success of the control phase.

 Chapter 16: Control 
  The last stage of a DMAIC project is control. During the control phase, teams build monitors that let 
them ensure the process continues to work successfully after changes are implemented across the 
regular business process. At the same time, Six Sigma teams work to transition the process back to the 
process owner. 
 Up until this point in the DMAIC process, Six Sigma teams have worked with statistical analysis tools, and 
a Black Belt or other Six Sigma 
expert has been present to walk team members through analysis and 
interpretation. While many organizations train process owners and other employees in Six Sigma 
fundamentals, it isn™t always true that a process owner and his or her team will be familiar wi
th the 
statistical controls that Six Sigma experts have been using. Because of that, appropriate documentation 

via a control plan and education regarding tools such as control charts might be necessary to ensure 
business teams can maintain a process and id
entify when it is out of control and needs remediation.
 Revise FMEA
 At this time, Six Sigma teams might want to revisit the FMEA tool originally introduced in chapter 13. Six 
Sigma teams initially use the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis to identify poten
tial failures in a process 
and causes of those failures. In chapter 13, we discussed how the FMEA listed potential failure points 
and ranked them according to severity, occurrence, and detection, calculating a total risk priority 
number. 
 At the end of the
 improve phase or beginning of the control phase, Six Sigma teams should revisit the 
FMEA, noting what recommended actions were completed and recalculating risk priority numbers for 
the improved process.  There are two reasons for revisiting the FMEA. Firs
t, the team is able to see that 
positive and significant changes have occurred because of the solutions adapted during the improve 
phase. For any root cause that matched a solution implemented, the team would hope to see a smaller 
risk priority number. 
 Second, an updated FMEA helps the team identify the next problem or root cause that might be 
addressed. Remember, Six Sigma is a continuous improvement initiative. The team might have 

implemented a solution and met an improvement goal, but further improvemen
ts can always be made. 
Control is a time to review the process and suggest possible improvements for future projects.
 Create a Control Plan
 To facilitate continued success, Six Sigma teams should create a written control plan for the process 

owner. The pur
pose of a control plan is to help the process owner and business team track and respond 
to key performance indicators so that the process remains improved. The control plan should be a 
concise, easy
-to-reference document that tells the business team when t
o monitor, how to monitor, 
what range of data is acceptable to the monitor, and how to respond with corrective action if the range 
measured is not acceptable.

 Control plans can be spreadsheets, specialized digital documents, or hard
-copy documents poste
d at a 
work station. Common elements of a control plan include:
  Company, division, or department name
  Name of person who created the plan
  Date the plan was created
  Name of the person who last edited the plan
  Date the plan was last edited
  Project and/or 
process name or identifier
  Process owner
  List of process steps where control action is required
  CTQ or metric associated with each action required
  Limit specifications, or the acceptable range of measurements
  The unit of measurement
  The method of measureme
nt
  The necessary sample size
  The frequency of measurement
  The person responsible for measurement
  Where the information is recorded
  Correction actions
  Associated policy and procedure documents
 In discussing quality in chapter 8, we introduced the example of
 a company that makes chocolate bars 
and noted that the amount of sugar in the chocolate bar recipe was critical to the customer™s experience 
with the end product. If a Six Sigma team were tasked with improving customer satisfaction with a new 
chocolate ba
r product, they might have implemented a solution that ensures the proper amount of 
sugar is added to the mixture at the right temperature to incorporate the ingredient appropriately.
 A control plan for the new chocolate bar solution might look something l
ike the document below.

  The above example control plan provides instructions for two specific steps in the process with easy
-to-understand measurement and
 monitor requirements. To reduce the chance of errors, the Six Sigma 
team has even specified a special measuring tool for measuring the sugar in the test batch so that every 
operator performing the monitor measures using the same tool.
 At the end of the co
ntrol document, the team provides steps for corrective action. The first step can be 
corrected by the operator, who has the ability to calibrate the machine 
him
 or herself. The temperature 
calibration in this case can™t be performed by the operator,
 which means the process has to be stopped 
so that someone can attend to the issue. Note that it is always preferable, when possible, to build 

corrective action at the process level, such as was done with the sugar measurement. This minimizes 

downtime, put
s employees more in control of the processes they own, and helps employees stay 
involved with the quality process.
 The control plan above assumes that manual measurements must be taken or recorded. Optimally, Six 

Sigma teams should look for ways to automat
e measurements, which means data can be continuously 
gathered and converted into statistical process controls such as control charts. Automated data 
gathering doesn™t mean a control plan isn™t necessary, it just means that a control plan won™t include 
inst
ructions for gathering the data. Instead, employees and process owners can be instructed to review 
automated data or control charts and take action if necessary.
 You™ll also note that the specification requirements given above are provided with LSL and USL
. LSL is 
the lower specification limit and the USL is the upper specification limit. These are the upper and lower 
limits of the acceptable range.

 Visual Management
 In addition to providing a control plan, Six Sigma teams can implement specific visual con
trols in a 
workplace to help business teams maintain a controlled process. Some of these tools were covered in 
chapter 4 on Lean process management, including 5S. Other visual controls teams might implement 
include signs, posted matrixes and instructions, 
auditing boards that let teams keep track of individual or 

group performance over time, color coding, and safety signals.
 Standard operating procedures can often be distilled to visual representations on posters. A coffee shop, 
for example, might provide e
mployees with a visual representation of what ingredients are used to 
create various complex drink flavors. Such a poster ensures that employees can prepare drinks quickly 
while reducing errors in ingredient inclusion. 
 Other SOP visualizations might inclu
de safety procedures in a medical environment, such as visual 
reminders for hand washing and short pictorial representations for how to operate equipment such as 
hospital beds. In an office environment, pictorial instructions are found on copy machines, wh
ere 
pictures indicate how paper should be loaded and visual gifs are often displayed on LED screens to help 
employees remove jammed paper. These are some examples that Six Sigma teams can follow when 

creating documents that will help business staff accept 
ownership of an improved process and maintain 
the improvements made.
 SPC Charts
 One of the most common methods Six Sigma teams use to monitor a process is the control chart. A 
number of types of control charts exist, and Six Sigma experts must choose the r
ight control chart for 
the type of data and analytical purpose. 
 Now, w
e™ll cover the visual tests that let a Six Sigma team or process owner kno
w that a process is out of 
control.
 A basic control chart has the following elements:
  A line chart of data with plot points for specific data points
  An x
-bar line representing the average of the data points
  Lines above and below the x
-bar line representing
 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the

   Above is an example of a control 
chart. The middle line, which is black, is the x
-bar line. The x
-bar line is 
bounded by green lines on both sides, indicating 1 and 2 standard deviations away from the mid
-line. 
Those lines are bounded by orange lines on either side: at the top, the upper 
control limit, and on 
bottom, the lower control limit. Between the various lines are areas of the control chart, designated as 
C, B, and A going in either direction. These distinct areas are important for understanding if a process 
might be out of control.
 They are also called Zones 1, 2, and 3.
 A control chart is best displayed using an automated reporting system or dashboard, where process 
owners or responsible employees can view it as needed. If automated data collection and control 
charting is not possi
ble, then a business analyst can be tasked with collecting data and presenting it in 
this format periodically, though periodic graphical analysis is less likely to catch a problem of control 

within a process.
 Statistical Process Control Tests: Control Char
ts Eight tests exist that can quickly tell someone viewing a control chart if a process is out of control. 
  Test one:
 A single point on the control chart appears outside of the upper or lower control 
limits. If this occurs, process owners should take immed
iate action, because it is evidence of a 
major problem within a process. While there is a very remote possibility that shifts outside of 

three standard deviations can occur randomly, the likelihood is only 3 in 1,000.
  Test two: 
Nine points in a row appear 
on one side of the center line. This indicates that a change 
occurred in the process; if the process owner knows what change caused the shift and it was 

intentional change, nothing needs to be done and the control chart will right itself over time 

with the
 new data. Otherwise, the process owner should investigate the process.
  Test three:
 Six points on the control chart increase or decrease in a row, indicating the process is 
becoming less or more efficient or is generating 
fewer 
or more errors. Process owne
rs should 
investigate unless there is a known reason for the trend.
  Test four: 
Fourteen points on the control chart in a row alternate moving up and down. This 
could indicate variation in machines, employees, shifts, or over correction.
  Test five:
 Two out 
of three points in a row on the control chart are in the upper A section or in 
the lower A section. This might indicate some type of special cause creating sudden high 

variation.

  Test six: 
Four out of five points in a row on the control chart are located i
n the upper B section 
(or beyond) or the lower B section (or beyond). This can indicate a problem of major causation 
or a shift problem similar to that of test four. 
  Test seven: 
Fifteen points in a row are located within the C section above or below the 
centerline. This can indicate that control limits are no longer relevant to the process; if a team 
has improved variation of a process, they should recalculate control limits to new parameters. 

Alternatively, this might occur temporarily when short
-term var
iation is high or low relative to 
the rest of the points on a control chart.
   Test eight: 
Eight points in a row on the control chart are located on either side of the center 

line, but none are located in the C section above or below the line. This could in
dicate an issue 
of mixed resources or processes; a team might think they are measuring a single process when 
they are actually measuring two process, for example. Alternatively, it could indicate a major 

difference in processing for two employees or teams.
 When it™s possible to create control charts and display current data on a regular basis, these charts make 

a good addition to a control plan. Individuals don™t have to be well
-versed in statistical process control 
to learn about the eight tests, and busin
ess teams with the benefit of control charts can spend more 
time working on production or correcting issues and less time collecting and documenting 
measurements.
 Control Versus Capability
 It™s important to note the distinction between a controlled process
 and one that is capable of meeting 
customer requirements. We touched on this concept in unit 1: controlled processes don™t have a lot of 
variation. Capable processes don™t have a lot of variation 
and the outputs center around a customer 
requirement. This 
is why both control limits and specification limits are important.
 Consider the example used earlier in this chapter about sugar in the chocolate mix. The specification 

limits ranged from 4.9 to 5.1 cups of sugar in each batch. It™s possible for a control 
chart to show that 
the process is in control if the measurements range from 3.5 to 3.6 cups of sugar per batch, but the 
process owner should know that those measurements aren™t going to contribute to a product that 
meets critical to customer quality requir
ements. 
 To understand how a process is performing against specification limits, Six Sigma teams can calculate 
sigma level and process capability.
 Sigma Level
 Sigma level is the number of standard deviations between the current process center, as measured 
by 

the median, and the nearest specification limit (not control limit.) The equation for sigma level is the 

smaller of the following calculations:
  
 
   For example, if a process has an USL of 5 and a LSL of 3, a standard deviation
 of .25 and a median of 4.2, 
then you would calculate from the USL, since the median is closer to the USL.

 .. = 3.2 = sigma level
   Process Capability
 Process capability is calculated by dividing the sigma level by 3. In the case of the example, the 
capability 
is 1.06.
 Process capability is denoted as C
pk.
 A process capability of 1.33 is equal to a sigma level of 4, which is 
what most experts agree is the minimal level at which most customers will be satisfied. Under statistical 
process control, many 
organizations aim for a process capability of 2.0 with minimal acceptable process 
capability at 1.5.
 Team Celebration and Reflection
 When Six Sigma teams deem improvements and the related process to be capable and in control, and 
they™ve passed those proce
sses back to business and process owner control, they should take time to 
celebrate and reflect on the outcome of the project. This is usually done following the final tollgate 
review with a sponsor or champion, and can be a quick meeting to close loose en
ds, recognize the work 
done by the team, and discuss lessons learned within the process.
 The celebration and reflection meeting is also a great time for team members to bring up ideas for 
possible improvement projects. While improvements 
Œ and the related 
problems and causes 
Œ are still 
fresh on the 
team™s 
minds, they can effectively brainstorm ideas for next steps. As with any 
brainstorming session, no idea should be automatically held off the table because it seems silly, would 
be too hard to implement, i
s too costly, or seems too big. Not all of the ideas will become future 
projects, but the team™s input provides valuable information that the Black Belt can later share with Six 

Sigma leadership panels.

 Unit 4: Beginner Statistics
 Chapter 17: Intermediate Graphical Analysis 
  Graphical analysis is a critical part of the Six Sigma approach. Whenever data or ideas can be displayed 
in a visual format, obvious data trends can be quickly identified and communicated. Visual analysis is 
extremely helpful when presenting ideas to auxiliary staff or executives, who might not be trained in 

intermediate or advanced statistics. The Black Belt 
or other Six Sigma experts have the ability to tell the 
same story that statistics tell, but in a format that can be understood by anyone. Visual depictions are 
tools that make it easier for Six Sigma professionals or sponsors to retell the story to others
, which can 
be helpful for training, building cultural buy
-in for a process change, or even resource requests.
 Throughout the first three units of this book, we™ve discussed a number of graphical analysis tools, 
including:
  Pareto charts in chapters 5 and 
14  Run charts in chapter 13
  Box plots in chapter 14
  Introduction to control charts in chapter 16
  Introduction to scatter diagrams in chapter 14
 In this chapter, we™ll discuss additional graphical analysis tools, including bar charts and pie charts. We™ll 

also look again at scatter diagrams and how to create them in Excel. In Chapter 16, you learned about 
the components of an X
-bar control chart and how to tell if a control chart indicates a process might be 
out of control. In this chapter, we™ll walk throug
h the steps for manually creating an X
-bar control chart 
in Excel. Finally, you™ll learn how to install a data analysis add
-in for various versions of Excel. The add
-in 
provides functionality that will become relevant in the next few chapters.
 Additional G
raphical Analysis Tools
 As with many other areas of the Six Sigma methodology, it can be easy to go overboard when dealing 

with graphical analysis 
Œ particularly when presenting information to others. With so many tools at your 
disposal, it™s tempting to p
ick the graph that is new, exciting, or more complex. Often, though, that 
means spending non
-value added time creating one visual tool when an easier tool would do the job. If 
you recall from chapter 4, this would be an instance of over
-processing to avoid
. Consider the two charts below to understand when over
-processing might be occurring with regard to 
graphical analysis.

    Both charts are a graphical representation of the same information. The first is a simple bar chart that 
was created within a few
 clicks in Excel. The second is a Pareto chart, also created in Excel but requiring 
many more clicks of the mouse. In this particular case, a Pareto chart is not necessary to convey the 

required information. The data is diverse enough that anyone can see f
rom looking at the bar chart that 
sales person E accounts for a lot of the errors. In this particular case, a Pareto chart is overselling the 

conclusion and doesn™t need to be created if extra work is required. 
 In this example, it™s possible that a visual
 portrayal of the data isn™t required at all: the conclusion is 
obvious. Looking at the raw data below, you can quickly see that employee E has triple the errors as the 

next
-highest employee. Even when the raw data provides for easy analysis, however, many
 Six Sigma 
experts do take the time to create a graphical representation for the purpose of presentations. A graph 

is more visually appealing and quicker to read than a data table.

Errors
 A 10 B 5 C 2 D 9 E 34 F 7 G 3  The simplest 
graphical analysis isn™t always the best choice, especially when data elements are not so 
obvious to note. More complex analysis might be required to discover outliers, relationships, and trends. 
Even when conclusions about data seem obvious, they aren™t a
lways correct. This is especially true when 
dealing with the relationship or correlation between factors in a process.
 As a Six Sigma expert, it takes time to be able to quickly choose which type of graphical analysis will best 

represent the data at hand. 
It™s also important to note that the best choice for graphical analysis relies 

equally on the questions being asked as much as it does on the data itself. In the example above, the 

basic bar chart is a good choice for a team that wants to know where errors
 might be coming from. If 
the team was comparing errors to shift times being worked, the bar chart would not be helpful.
 While it™s true that you don™t want to waste time and space presenting data in a way that is not helpful 
Œ or could be considered muda 
of over
-production 
Œ the same isn™t always true when dealing with 
analysis. At the analysis stage of a DMAIC project, Black Belts and other Six Sigma experts often work 
with numerous graphical analysis tools as they attempt to understand data. The need to 
view data in 
various ways is one reason statistical analysis software is helpful: such software takes some of the 
manual work out of creating these charts and graphs. Trial
-and
-error work with all types of Six Sigma 
analysis tools also helps you learn to i
dentify which tools fit each situation best.
 In this section, we™ll discuss some tools that haven™t been introduced so far, covering benefits, 
limitations, and how to create the tools in Excel without statistical analysis software when necessary.
 Bar Chart
s One of the biggest benefits of bar charts is that they are recognizable and easy to read. Almost any 
employee in a company can glean information from a properly formatted bar chart without instruction 
or guidance, making them a great choice for general u
se presentations and training materials. Bar charts 
are also easy to create, so they are a preferred method of illustration in presentations and reports. 

Other benefits include:
  The ability to summarize large data sets in a simple visual format
  The ability
 to clarify trends
  The fact that most people can easily estimate important values on a well
-formatted bar chart
  The ability to visually check data and identify areas where data might be skewed
  The ability to easily display data sets that range above and be
low zero on the same chart

 Bar charts typically require nominal or ordinal data 
Œ data that is classified according to qualitative 
information. When displaying nominal data, it™s often beneficial to create a Pareto
-style chart so the 
reader can see instant
ly how the population relates to the categories. Ordinal data usually involves its 
own logical order for presentation. For example, if individuals are asked to rank satisfaction with a 
product as very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neutral, unsatisfied, an
d very unsatisfied, then you usually 
would not want to change the order of that presentation on a bar chart.
 Bar charts are not without limitations. Depending on what is being presented, additional narrative might 

be required to explain the chart. Bar char
ts also often fail to reveal key information about trends that 
aren™t part of the specific design of the chart, and they rarely on their own provide detailed data about 
causes or patterns in data. Finally, it™s easy to manipulate colors, order, and layout 
of a bar chart to 
influence the message that your audience takes away. Six Sigma experts should always choose the best 
format for displaying fundamental truths, but should never format a chart to create an impression that 
might not be in keeping with the s
tatistical data behind the graphical representation.
  Create a Bar Chart in Excel
 Create your own bar charts in Excel by starting with data tables of relevant nominal or ordinal data. 
Copy the data table below into Excel to practice bar chart creation, or 
use data relevant to your own 
processes or projects. The sample data table provides the total number of phone calls experienced by a 
regional customer service call
-center team for each hour in a particular day.

   Most versions of Excel offer several types of bar charts, and you can experiment with these various 
formats to see how they display your data.
 Some notes about common formats are included below.
 Column versus 
Bar Technically, what is commonly referred to as a bar chart 
Œ and what we™ve been calling a bar chart here 
Œ is a column chart. The visual columns representing each data category rise vert
ically. A literal bar chart 
displays the same information horizontally. Most versions of Excel let you choose between the two 

displays. The information from the example data table is presented below in a horizontal bar chart.

 3-D Bar and 
Column 
Charts
  The charts displayed so far in this chapter are all 2
-dimensional. Excel can also help you create 3
-dimensional charts to add visual appeal to a presentation. 3
-D charts are helpful if you are presenting a 
number of similar
-looking charts in a row, as it 
helps to differentiate between information in your 
presentation. It might also be helpful to create more visually appealing charts simply to capture 
audience attention more fully. Here™s an example of the same data used above in a 3
-D chart.
  Stacked 
Bar 
Charts
 Stacked bar charts let you display the total nominal or ordinal data for each category while also breaking 

that information into color coded categories. For example, if the Six Sigma team analyzing phone calls 
per hour wanted to display data that in
cluded how many calls were handled by separate teams within a 
department, the bar chart might look something like the image below.

 Create a Stacked Bar Chart
 To create a stacked bar chart, you must have ordinal or nominal data that is broken into categor
ies. The 
categories must be the same for each data set so that the total of the sub
-category numbers equals the 
total of the main category. For example, if you have three bags of marbles, you might have data that 

says:
 Bag Number of marbles
 1 10 2 3 3 15  Upon further analysis, you realize you have marbles in three colors: red, blue, and yellow. 
  Bag 1
 Bag 2
 Bag 3
 Red
 7 1 5 Yellow
 3 1 8 Blue
 0 1 2  Bag 1 doesn™t include any blue marbles, but you must include blue as a category for Bag 1 because it is a 
category in the other two bags. You simply put a 0 in that data field. You™ll note that the totals of the 
subcategories under each bag add up to the a
mount of marbles in each bag. Following these guidelines 
Œ including all subcategories for each section 
and ensuring the subcategories total correctly 
Œ helps you 
create accurate stacked bar charts.
  Examine the data table below, which displays the breakdo
wn of calls by teams in the call center.

  Pie Charts
 The pie chart is another visual tool that almost any employee in a business environment will be familiar 
with, making it a good choice for disp
laying certain types of information. Ordinal and nominal 
information can also be displayed in a pie chart with the main purpose of visually representing how each 
category relates to the whole. Conventional wisdom says to use a pie chart when the numbers yo
u are 
charting add up to 100, but this doesn™t have to be the case. Excel converts values to percentages to 
create pie charts. Consider the pie chart below, which graphs the numbers 8, 5, and 4. Excel considers 
each of these numbers against the total ﬁpieﬂ
 of 17. The blue section, which represents 47%, 
corresponds to the raw data 8/17.
  Benefits of pie charts include:
  The ability to summarize large amounts of specific data types in a visual format.
  Simplicity; the pie chart is one of the simplest types of 
graphs
  The ability to identify obvious problems with data or calculations
  Pie charts usually require very little extra explanation when labeled correctly
  Pie charts display the relevance of subset data within a total data set
 The fact that pie charts are u
sed constantly in business environments is both an advantage and 
disadvantage for Six Sigma teams and experts. When data can be depicted in a pie chart, the Six Sigma 
expert usually has to create less narrative to get a potential point across. At the same 
time, pie charts 
don™t always carry the weight that a more advanced statistical representation might because business 
employees are so used to seeing them. Other disadvantages of pie charts include the fact that they can 
be manipulated in much the same way
 as bar charts, they usually fail to easily display changes over time, 
and it can be difficult to visualize exact values when presented with a pie chart.
 Create a Pie Chart in Excel
 Practice creating a pie chart in Excel using the following data table, whi
ch records how many minutes 
are spent on average for each step of a process. You can also use data relevant to your own process or 
project to create a practice pie chart if desired.

  From the pie chart created for our sample data, we can see that approximately half of the total process 
time is related to only two steps in the 10
-step process. We can also quickly see which steps take the
 longest on average and which are the shortest, although we can™t draw any conclusions about actual 
time from only this chart.
 As with bar charts, you can take advantage of Excel options for creating three
-dimensional pie charts. A 
particularly helpful fun
ction is the Pie of Pie function in Excel, which lets you create an overall pie chart 
and carve out a second pie chart to delve deeper into certain areas of the larger structure. Consider a 
Pie of Pie chart below, which represents the same data from the pi
e chart above.

 The original pie chart depicted 10 steps. The illustration above shows a large pie chart with a secondary 
chart. The large pie chart appears to show 7 steps 
Œ but this pie chart shows the same information as 
the one above. However, four st
eps from the process are called out in a smaller chart so you can see 
how they relate to each other better. Those four steps combined make up the 7
th, dark
-blue pie piece in 
the larger pie. This makes it easier to pinpoint relevance of smaller data categor
ies within the whole or 

to emphasize a certain area of the chart. 
 You do have to be careful, however, that the viewer doesn™t assign relevance or importance based solely 

on the size of the pie pieces. The gray pie piece in the secondary chart above is big
ger than some of the 
other pieces in the larger pie, but that doesn™t mean that step takes longer. The smaller pie should be 
considered a large
-scale view of a small piece of the overall graph. In this case, that small piece takes 
into account four of the 
steps.
 X Y Scatter Diagrams 
 We introduced scatter diagrams very briefly in chapter 14, and we™ll revisit them in depth in later 
chapters on correlation and regression modeling. In this section, we™ll cover how to create a scatter 
diagram in Excel with any
 analysis add
-on. In chapter 19, we™ll use an add
-on for Excel to conduct some 
statistical analysis while creating scatter diagrams. 
 Scatter diagrams are beneficial because they can help teams visually see the relationship between two 
factors in a process. Does temperature decrease over time? Does a person™s productivity increase with 
his or her salary? These are examples of questions t
hat might be answered by scatter diagrams, but it™s 
important to realize that correlation as depicted on a scatter diagram doesn™t necessarily mean 
causation. Two variables can be closely related without one causing changes in the other. 
 Scatter diagrams 
typically help teams see whether there is no correlation, weak correlation, or positive 
or negative correlation. Positive correlation occurs when variable 2 is related to an increase in variable 1, 
or vice versa. Negative correlation occurs when variable 2
 is related to a decrease in variable 1, or vice 
versa. For example, it is commonly noted that the rate of crime and the average
 per
-capita income of 
geographic areas in the United States are related. Areas that demonstrate higher crime rates often also 
de
monstrate lower income statistics. The statement can be made the other direction: areas that 
demonstrate lower income statistics often demonstrate higher crime rates. That is not to say that either 
of these things necessarily causes the other. 
 Drawbacks o
f scatter diagrams are that they are not as familiar to business employees as bar, pie, or 
even line charts. There is also a risk that individuals who don™t have an understanding of statistical 
analysis will mistake correlation for causation, which can lea
d to incorrect decisions. Black Belts and 
other Six Sigma experts must be cognizant of these risks so they can appropriately explain scatter 
diagrams and 
provide 
further explanation when necessary.
 Create a Scatter Diagram in Excel
 Use the data table below
, which includes the average number of errors per hour a process creates as 

output is increased per hour to create a scatter diagram in Excel. Copy the information from the table

   From the scatter diagram created, we can see that the two variables 
Œ production volume and errors 
Œ appear to be related in some manner. While it™s a good bet that increased production actually 
causes
 increased errors, you can™t simply assume causation fr
om this graph. This assumption could be further 
tested using more advanced statistical techniques.
 It should be noted that, even when correlation seems obvious on a scatter diagram, it isn™t always the 
case. Six Sigma experts should always test correlation
 assumptions to ensure they are correct 
statistically before presenting a scatter diagram to others as an illustration of a relationship. We™ll cover 
statistical regression and correlation tests in chapter 19. 
 Creating an X
-Bar Control Chart without Stati
stical Software
 The X
-bar control chart plots the mean of a sample over time 
Œ or the mean of samples taken over time, 
in the case of an active process. X
-bar control charts are one of the most frequently used control charts
. Some 
control charts can also be created in Excel using these steps; more advanced control charts 
require statistical analysis software.

=STDEV(A2:A15)
 a. The cell references A2:A15 should be edited to correspond to your actual data list. 
 b.
 This calculates the standard deviation of your data set.
 4. In cell G5, enter the formula 
=AVERAGE(A2:A15)
 a. The cell references A2:A15 should be edited to correspond to your actual data list.
 b.
 This calculates the mean of your data set.
 5. In cell G2, enter the formula: 
=G5+3*(G1)
 a. This calculates an upper control limit that is three standard deviations above the mean.
 6. In cell G3, enter the formula: 
=G5
-3*(G1)
 a. This calculates a lower control limit that is three standard deviations below the mean.
 7. In the UCL column (B), direct Excel to create a column of numbers where every number is equal to 
the upper control limit by co
pying =$G$2 into each cell in a row that has an X
-bar data point in 
column A.
 8. In the LCL column (C), direct Excel to create a column of numbers where every number is equal to 
the lower control limit by copying =$G$3 into each cell in a row that has an X
-ba
r data point in 
column A.
 9. In the Mean column, direct Excel to create a column of numbers where every number is equal to 
the mean by copying =$G$5 into each cell in a row that has an X
-bar data point in column A.
 (Practice steps 1 through 9 with the 
following data.)

   12. Right click on the data labels for the Y axis and select ﬁFormat Axis.ﬂ
 13. Alter the bounds for the axis to remove excess white space in your control chart. In this case, we™ll
 change bounds from 0 to 35 to 15 to 35.
   14. Format the chart as desired for color, titles, and data labels. You now have a very basic control 
chart.

   One thing you™ll note missing from this control chart is the lines that denote one and two standard 
deviations above and below the mean. In chapter 16, you learned that those lines help you apply the 

tests that determine if a process is in control or not. You can easily add those lines by following the steps 

below.
 Add Standard Deviation Lines
 1. Add calcul
ations to your spreadsheet for:
 a. The mean plus one standard deviation
 b.
 The mean plus two standard deviations
 c. The mean minus one standard deviation
 d.
 The mean minus two standard deviations
 2. Add four data columns, one for each of the calculations in step one. Cop
y the numbers from 
each of the calculations down the columns as you did with the upper and lower control limits 

and the mean in the original instructions above.
 3. The spreadsheet should now appear similar to the image below.

   This process might seem very time consuming, but it only takes a few 
minutes once you are well
-versed 
in the elements of a control chart.
 It™s 
a good idea to know how to create control charts in Exce
l, 
because Six Sigma experts can™t always rely on access to statistical analysis software.  
 Adding Free Data Analysis Tools to Excel
 You 
can complete these calculation
s by hand, but that can be time consuming and require extremely 
advanced statistical skill sets. 
We will start with manual calculations because it helps to understand the 
reasoning behind an analysis. But w
e™ll also rely heavily on tools that complete most of the calculations. 
Not only does statistical analysis software minimize the time it takes to conduct such analysis, but it also 
reduces the chance of calculation errors and increases the accuracy of anal
ysis and conclusions offered 
by Six Sigma experts.
 For lessons covered in the next few chapters, you can rely on the free data analysis tool available from 
Microsoft for Excel. To add this free tool in Excel 2013 and higher, follow the steps below.

  7. Click OK
 8. Check that the Analysis ToolPak was installed by selecti
ng ﬁDataﬂ from the Excel menu bar and 
looking for the Data Analysis option.
     If the Analysis ToolPak doesn™t appear as an Add
-In option, that means it wasn™t installed when your 
version of Excel was installed. If you are using Excel that was installed 
from a disk, you™ll need to locate 
your software CDs and either reinstall the software or complete a custom install of just the Analysis 
ToolPak file.

 The Analysis ToolPak is also available in earlier versions of Excel. In 2003 and earlier versions of Excel, 
you™ll find the Add

 Chapter 18: Normal Probability Distributions
  Now that you™ve downloaded the Analysis ToolPak in chapter 17, you can begin learning more detailed 
statistical 
analysis. In this chapter, we™ll discuss how and when to use a normal probability curve to draw 
inferential statistics. Now is a good time to know the difference between descriptive statistics and 

inferential statistics.
 Descriptive statistics
 Descriptive 
statistics
 are numbers used to describe a set of data. Given a set of data about the 
employees in a company, for example, someone might say
, ﬁOver 50 percent of the employees work in 
sales or marketing departments,ﬂ or
, ﬁ86 percent of the employees live in
 the same zip code that the 
office is located in.ﬂ These are descriptive statistics because they simply discuss the nature of the data at 
hand. Averages, means, and even standard deviations associated with that data are all descriptive in 
nature.
 Inferenti
al statistics
 Inferential statistics
 involve calculations and resulting numbers that draw more general conclusions from 
data. For example, if you have data about a sample of 150 employees in a city 
Œ not all the employees 
from a single business, but random
 employees from different companies 
Œ you might be able to use 
inferential statistics to draw conclusions about all the working individuals in that city based on the data 

in your sample. 
  Descriptive statistics can relate to population data or sample data
. Inferential statistics are used to draw 
conclusions about the population from sample data. If you randomly select 20 people from an overall 
population and record their height, then the mean of the recorded heights is a descriptive statistic about 

the sam
ple size. Descriptive statistics about the sample are used in calculations for inferential statistics 
about a population. 
 Probability distributions
 Probability is the likelihood that a certain event or outcome will occur given a specific set of data or a 
specific action. If you flip a coin one time, the probability of it coming up heads is 1 in 2, or 50 percent. 
  When discussing basic probability, we talk about outcomes and events. The outcome is the result of one 
trial: you flip the coin once or you rand
omly select a single item from the sample. The event is a specific 
outcome or outcomes. The coin coming up heads is an event. A person measuring 5 feet tall is an event 
if you are talking about selecting from a population or sample. 
 Basic probability can 
be calculated by the formula:
  Page | 
212
  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 =#  
 
   
#   
  In the case of the coin, there are two possible events, or outcomes, that can occur when you flip it. Only 
one of those events is 
coming up heads. Therefore, ½ = .5, or 50 percent. 
 In the case of rolling a six
-sided die, there are six possible events. You can roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The 
probability of rolling a 5 is 1/6, or .167.  The probability of rolling either a 4 or a 5, ho
wever, is 2/6, or 
.33.
  While probability measurements can be expressed as a percentage, they are calculated and usually 
communicated in statistics as a decimal point. Since probabilities are presented as fractions, the lowest 

probability possible is 0 and
 the highest is 1. A probability of 0 means an impossible event; a probability 
of 1 means a certain event.
  Basic Probability Practice
  Twenty marbles are placed in a bag. They are all the same size, but are different colors as follows:
 - 3 red
 - 5 black
 - 8 blue
 - 4 green
 What is the probability that a green marble would be pulled from the bag?
  
 4 / 20  = 0.2
  What is the probability a blue or a black marble would be pulled from the bag?
   13 / 20 = 0.65 
  What is the probability a yellow marble would be pulle
d from the bag?
   0 / 20 = 0

   Note: 
This is an impossible task, because there are no yellow marbles in the bag.
  Applying Basic Probability Concepts to Six Sigma Analysis
  In a Six Sigma setting, you aren™t dealing with marbles and bags, but the ideas of
 probability are 
somewhat similar. If a process produces 100 products an hour and two of those products are defective, 
the probability of receiving a defective product within that hour is 2/100, or 0.02. However, it™s rare that 

a team or business unit woul
d review all 100 products that were produced that hour to know that 2 out 
of 100 are defective. That information is also only useful for stating probabilities with relation to that 
particular hour of output, given that the sample wouldn™t be random.
  Inste
ad, Six Sigma experts randomly sample the population of all outputs of a process for a certain 
amount of time. They create descriptive statistics about that sample and use the descriptive statistics to 
further study and understand the nature of the data th
ey are working with. Once they know the nature 
of the data, they can work with probability distributions and curves to determine probability via 
calculations and statistical analysis. In this chapter, we™ll discuss how to work with what is called normal 
pr
obability distributions.
  Histograms
 Before moving forward with probability distributions, it™s important to understand histograms. 
Histograms are another graphical analysis tool. Technically, histograms are bar charts where each bar, or 

ﬁbin,ﬂ corresponds to a data range. Data points within 
a sample or population are divided between the 
bins and are graphed accordingly. 
  Histograms are used to analyze continuous or variable data that is finite in nature or comes from 
population sampling. Histograms help Six Sigma experts understand how the s
pread, or distribution, of 
the data is shaped and where the center of that data might be. The center is the average or middle of 

the data spread, though the mean or median values aren™t always located at the center of a histogram. 
A histogram also shows th
e range of the data 
Œ the variation between the highest value of the data set 
and the lowest value of the data set. Finally, the histogram™s shape provides information about where 
the data is concentrated. 
  Consider the two histograms below. In the first,
 the data elements are concentrated toward the center. 
The histogram approximates what is called the bell curve, or normal curve. This shape is likely to 
indicate that the data used to create the histogram is normal data, which will be discussed further la
ter 
in this chapter.

  The second histogram depicts data that is concentrated at either end of the range. When two specific 
concentrations, or humps, are noted on a histogram, this is called bi
-modal distribution. Often, when 
you see this shape of data, it 
means that you are measuring two processes that you believe are a single 
process. For example, if two different people are performing a piece of work, they might have different 
outcomes that result in two different humps on the histogram. If bi
-modal data 
does 
come from a single 
process, then the data is not normal
.         Histograms can also have several other common shapes, especially when presenting non
-normal data or 
data that has an error or issue. If the histogram
 appears very random, as in the first example below, 
then it™s possible an error lies within the data measurement process. The measurement might not be 
adequate to capture the true picture of the process, or the definition of the operation and how to 
colle
ct data might be at fault. The same is true if the histogram depicts an almost even distribution of 
data elements among bins.

  A skewed distribution, seen in the second diagram above, features data that is clustered at only one end 
of the graph. Skewed
 histograms are common with certain types of data, particularly when data ﬁfalls 
offﬂ at a natural cut
-off time. For example, in a call center, you might measure the time it takes 
representatives to complete a certain type of phone call. A natural end
-poin
t for that data is 0 
Œ it will 
always take more than 0 seconds to complete a phone call. Usually, it will take more than a few seconds, 
so you won™t have many data points in the lower end of the range. Perhaps this particular phone call 
follows a script an
d the majority of the calls end at the 7 to 8
-minute mark. A histogram for length of 
calls might look something like the chart below.
     Consider the basic example below to understand histograms further.

 A local distribution company wants to understand 
more about how well delivery drivers are meeting 
estimated arrival times. The team pulls a random sample of deliveries from a week™s worth of 
information and considers two data points for each delivery: the estimated time of delivery and the 
actual time of
 delivery. They subtracted the actual time from the estimated time to determine how far 
off one way or the other the deliveries were. The result was the following data table.

 -14  To create a histogram, the team 
sorted the selection by difference in minutes and discovered the range 
as 
-27 to 48. The team decided to create a histogram from 
-30 to 50 with a bin size of 10. The resulting 
data is as follows:
 Bin Frequency
 -30 0 -20 2 -10 3 0 5 10 8 20 2 30 0 40 2 50 3  To create the above table, the team simply counted how many data points fell in each bin. The data 
points 
-27 and 
-25 fell into the bin 
-20 (to 
-29); that is 2 data points. Eight data points fell into the 10 bin. 
When charted on a bar chart, 
this information creates a histogram.

   When dealing with histograms, the number of bins used is important. If you have too few bins, the 
graph doesn™t provide any relevant information. If you have too many bins for the data set in question, 
you also lose
 informative functionality and your graph, rather than appearing as a rough curve, becomes 
something that looks like a comb. Usually, the more data you have, the more bins you can include on 
your histogram.
  Consider the following four histograms that all 
represent the same set of data. The data features 150 
random numbers ranging from 38.62 to 62.89.

    The bin sizes get progressively smaller as the number of bins increase. In the first chart, bin sizes are 5; 
in the last chart, bin sizes are 
0.5.  For the purposes of understanding what type of data is represented in 

this histogram, the second or third charts are probably the most relevant. We™ll cover determining data 
type from a histogram and associated statistics later in this chapter.
  Crea
ting a Histogram in Excel
 Before moving on with probability distributions, we™ll look at creating histograms in Excel using the 
Analysis ToolPak that was discussed in the last chapter.

 Excel automatically generates a bin and frequency table as well as a histogram graph in a new 
worksheet. The histogram design defaults to a 
standard bar graph, but you can create the look of the 
histograms previously shown by changing one setting on the design.
  1. Click on the histogram.
 2. Select Design from the top menu. 
  3. Under Quick Layout, choose the layout where the bars are stacked next to 
each other rather 
than with space between them.
   Your result should look like the graph below.

  Experiment with your own data, creating histograms with various bin sizes to begin to develop an 
understanding of how data converts to this type of chart. 
 Normal Distributions
 Normal distribution, also called Gaussian distribution, is probably the most important dist
ribution 
related to continuous data from a statistical analysis standpoint. A normal, or Gaussian, distribution is 
depicted below.
  Page | 
227

 Normal data is shaped symmetrically surrounding the mean, represented above by the x
-bar line. A 
normal curve is beneficial
 for determining the probability that a given data point in a population will fall 
inside a certain range within the distribution. 
  In a perfect normal distribution, 68.26 percent of all data points fall within plus or minus one standard 
deviation from th
e mean; this area is represented by the red arrow on the visual above. The blue arrow, 
which covers plus or minus two standard deviations from the mean, indicates the area under the curve 

that includes 95.46 percent of the data points. The purple area, whi
ch covers plus and minus three 
standard deviations from the mean, indicates the portion of the curve that covers 99.73 percent of the 

data. Less than 1 percent of data will fall under the curve outside of three standard deviations on either 

side.
  Distribu
tions 
Œ even normal distributions 
Œ vary a bit. To determine the exact probabilities of various 
data points, advanced statistics are required; Excel and other programs perform the calculations for you, 
making it easier to conduct analysis. Before we discus
s probability calculations using Excel, we™ll look at 
determining whether your data is normal in the first place. 
  Testing whether data is normal is critical to many steps in statistical analysis, because the results of 
many tests can be invalid if you do
n™t account for the data you are working with. The most basic form of 
many of these tests are designed to work with normal data.
  Normality Testing in Excel: Chi
-Squared Goodness
-of-Fit Test
 We™ve touched on how visual inspection can help you determine whe
ther data is normal or not. The 
histogram below, taken from earlier in the chapter, presents what seems to be obviously normal data. 
Data points converge around the center, and the histogram is roughly symmetrical in nature.

  But what about this 
histogram, which is the one created in the practice exercise in the section on 
creating histograms in Excel?
  The histogram above is an example of a chart that doesn™t fall neatly into any of the histogram shapes 
previously discussed. It seems to have ele
ments of the normal curve, but it could also be skewed data. 
This is why we perform statistical tests to determine normality.
  You™ll usually begin exploring probability data by following the instructions in the previous section to 
create a histogram for t
he data. For the example of the normality test, we™ll use the same data from the 
section above, which is:

  Use the Descriptive Statistics option in the Analysis ToolPak to quickly generate descriptive statistics for 
your data set. 
  1. Select Data > Data Analysis > Descriptive Statistics
 2. Click 
OK 3. Click in the Input Range box 
and select your input range using the mouse.
   4. In this case, the data is grouped by columns. In most statistical analysis, that will be the case, but 
if you have data grouped by rows, you should change the Grouped By selection.
 5. Select to output informatio
n in a new worksheet. 
 6. Ensure at least the Summary statistics box is checked. You can also check the Confidence level 

for mean and the Kth largest and smallest boxes, though that information isn™t required in the 

Chi

OK. 8. Excel returns descriptive summary statistics for your data
 set.
    For the Chi
-Squared Goodness

-Fit test, you will need to note the sample size (or count), the same 
standard deviation, and the sample mean. The sample size is the number of items in the data set, which

 was 50 for this example. If you don™t reme
mber what the sample size was, you can refer to the count 
listed in the descriptive statistics. The other two figures are taken from the descriptive statistics above: 
  - Sample mean: 
48.778
 - Sample standard deviation: 11.444
 Set up the hypothesis. 
  The Chi
-Squared Goodness
-of
-Fit test is actually a hypothesis test. That means you are testing the data 
with regard to a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis. 
The two 
hypotheses 
for the 
Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit test are:
   Null hypothesis: The data is normal.
  Alternative hypothesis: The data is not normal.
 If one is not true, then the other is. In statistical terms, we talk in terms of accepting or rejecting the null 
hypothesis. If we r
eject the null, we accept the alternative.
  Understand the Chi
-Squared Goodness
-of-Fit test premise
.  Basically, the Chi
-Squared Goodness
-of
-Fit test takes the number of samples in each bin on the 
histogram and compares that to the number of samples you mi
ght expect to find in each bin given a 
normal curve. Using the actual number of samples in each bin and the expected number of samples, we 
can calculate what is called the Chi
-Square
 Statistic in Excel. That number then lets us calculate a p
-Value. 
In this case, it is the size of the p
-Value that lets us decide whether to accept or reject the 
hypothesis that the data is normal.
  For the purpose of the Chi
-Squared Goodness
-of
-Fit test in this situation, if the p
-Value is greater than 
0.05, we will accept the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.
  The Observed Bins
 Having created a histogram via the Analysis ToolPak, you already have access to the observed bin 
distribution. That information is housed in the data table Excel creates to make the histogram.

 0  The Expected Bins
 We can use statistics related to the normal curve to calculate how we might expect bins to behave given 
the median and standard deviation of our sample.
  To give you an idea of what is going 
on with the statistical calculations involved in determining expected 
size of bins, consider the graphic below.
  Page |

   This graphic roughly depicts the bins from our histogram drawn on the normal curve. Because 
mathematical formulations exist for determining the area under a curve, it™s possible to determine the 
area under the curve within a specific bin. Ultimately, that 
is done by calculating the total area and 
subtracting portions. 
  We begin with a calculation known as the Cumulative Distribution Function, or CDF. The CDF measures 
the total area under a curve to the left of the point we are measuring from. For example, 
the total area 
under the curve above that is to the left of 45 is 50 percent. Once we know the CDF at each border of 
our bins, it™s a matter of subtraction to calculate the CDF for each individual bin. For example, the CDF 
for the bin located between 40 an
d 45 would equal the CDF of 45 minus the CDF of 40.
  One problem with this rough depiction is that the curve drawn above centers on 45, and we know from 
Excel that our mean is 48.778. We™ll use that number in our calculations to account for the slight shif
t.  Excel can calculate CDF with the formula:
  =NORMDIST(x value, Sample Mean, Sample Standard Deviation, TRUE)
  
Set up the tables for calculating the CDF of each bin by copying the bin designations onto the descriptive 
statistics worksheet that Excel prev
iously created for you and creating two columns, one for total CDF 
and one for bin CDF. Use the image below as an example.

   Enter the formula for calculating CDF into column E, referencing the same mean and standard deviation 
for each row and using the 
numbers in D as X.

    For the first row 
Œ in our case, the bin marked 10 
-- the bin
-only area is equal to the CDF because there is 
nothing left of the bin™s upper limit. For all other rows, the bin
-only area is the CDF minus the CDF for 
the bin designa
tion above. So, you would enter =E2 in the first data row for column F. The second data 
row would be calculated as E3
-E2; the next would be E4
-E3, and so forth. The result is the percentage of 
the curve in each bin.
    Calculating the expected number of s
amples in each bin is as easy as multiplying the percentages of 
each bin by the sample size. Again, you can see from the descriptive statistics that the count for this set 
of data was 50.

     To calculate the Chi
-Squared statistic, you™ll use both the e
xpected number of items in each bin and the 
actual or observed number. Copy the observed numbers over from your histogram worksheet.

 Apply the following formula to each row:
  (expected 
Œ observed)
2 / expected
  Calculate the final numbers for each row a
s desired in Excel.
    Add up the final numbers to get the Chi
-Squared statistic, denoted by X
2. For our example, X
2 is 16.7333.
  To use the Chi
-Squared statistic to find the p
-Value, we also need one more item for the Excel formula to 
work: we need what is called the degrees of freedom. 
 
 Degrees of freedom = #bins 
Œ 1 - #calculated parameters
  
We have 14 bins. The parameters we use
d to arrive at the Chi
-Squared statistic that we calculated from 
our sample were the mean and standard deviation: two parameters. For our example:
  Page | 
240

8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 Degrees of freedom = 14 
Œ 1 Œ 2 = 11
  Now that we have both the degrees of freedom (df), and the Chi
-Squared
 value, we can use Excel to 
calculate the p
-Value. Simply enter the formula below, inputting the correct values.
   In the case of our example, the resulting p
-Value is 0.116. Because the p
-Value is greater than 0.05, we 
accept the null hypothesis. Our dat
a is normal.
     Normal Probabilities
  Once you verify that your data is normal, you can use many statistical tests to draw conclusions about 
the data and the population as a whole from your sample. One of the things you can do is use Excel™s 
normal probab
ility functions to draw conclusions about data.
   For example, let™s assume that the data we™ve been working with throughout this chapter is a sample 
selection of the weights of boxes in a delivery channel. The 50 samples were taken from the same 
shipping 
center over the course of a week and were randomly selected. Given that we know the data is 
normal, what is the probability that any package selected from the distribution center will weigh over 50 
pounds?
  Excel provides the following formula:
  Page | 
241
  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 =NORMDIST(x, mean, standard_dev, cumulative)
  When using this formula:
 - X = the value you are testing
 - Mean = sample mean from the descriptive statistics
 - Standard_dev = sample standard deviation from the descriptive statistics
 - Cumulative = FALSE if you want 
to test the probability of the exact occurrence; TRUE if you want 
to test the probability of any value left of x on the curve (or, in most cases, less than x)
  Entering the formula in Excel for our data set with a FALSE cumulative tells us there is a 3.47 
percent 
chance of a randomly selected box weighing 50 pounds. This is a 
real
 and important piece of information 
that might be beneficial to a Six Sigma team.
  Entering the formula in Excel for our data set with a TRUE cumulative tells us there is a 54.25 p
ercent 
chance of a randomly selected box weighing less than 50 pounds. Subtracting from 100 percent leaves a 
45.75 percent chance that a box will weigh over 50 pounds. 
  Why might this be important? In this particular case, a shipping manager might be work
ing to hire 
shipping reps. Because there is a strong likelihood that the employees will handle boxes over 50 pounds, 
the manager knows to include that requirement in job descriptions. Or, a Six Sigma team might be 
working on a process to increase productio
n in a warehouse; the knowledge that many of the boxes are 
heavy enough to require special handling is relevant to how the team approaches the process.
  Six Sigma teams can use Excel to generate a lot of information about the data. Excel also provides a 
formula for the inverse of the above calculation. What if the team wanted to know about the weight of 
the heaviest 80 percent of boxes in the shipping center? 
  The formula is:
  =NORMINV
(probability
, mean, standard_dev)
  Probability must be entered as a deci
mal point, not a percent. In the case of 0.8 in our example data set, 
all of the boxes in the heaviest 80 percent are above 58.40 pounds.

   Because we are drawing statistical conclusions from samples, there is some error inherent in the 
process. Error is u
sually calculated for in advanced analysis
.  How to apply statistical data and conclusions to a business or project approach is covered in depth in the 
next unit, where we™ll look at how 
these concepts can generate real information that is applicable to 

business processes.

 Chapter 19: Correlation and Regression
  Correlation and regression are statistical concepts that help Six Sigma teams understand whether two 
factors within a process 
are related. You can use these tools to calculate whether an input is related to 
an output in some way or even whether two inputs might be related. The concept of correlation and 

regression was introduced in chapter 14 in the section on scatter diagrams. I
n this chapter, you™ll learn 
how to calculate the correlation coefficient in Excel, and what that number means, as well as how to 
create linear regression models in Excel to test relationships between a dependent and independent 
variable.
 It's worth coveri
ng a point made in chapter 14 again. Strong correlation or regression between two 
variables 
does not
 indicate a causal relationship. Even when strong regression is found between a 
dependent and independent variable, it doesn™t mean that the dependent resul
t is 
caused
 by the 
independent variable. This is a critical concept to understand, because attributing causation because 
correlation is strong can mean making poor decisions regarding a process. A team might decide to alter 
or remove one element because it
 has a strong correlation to an output; they might then be surprised 
that the output doesn™t change because it wasn™t in a causal relationship with the input in question.
 Why work with correlation and regression at all?
 Correlation and regression is still 
important to understand, because it helps teams understand more 

about processes, analyze how elements of a process are related, and make predictions about a process. 
When two elements are strongly related along a linear line 
Œ or even along a curve 
Œ teams
 can create 
equations linking the two elements. This lets Six Sigma teams predict how the dependent element will 
perform if a change is made in the independent variable. 
 Before moving forward, it should be noted that the analysis tools in this chapter don
™t assume normal 
data in all cases, but it is possible that very abnormal data can skew results. Before analyzing data, Six 
Sigma experts should always understand what type of data they are working with.
 Correlation
 Typically, when talking about correlatio
n, we mean the linear association that exists between two 
variables. In chapter 14, we introduced the concept that correlation can be strong or weak; it can also be 
positive or negative.
 Positive Correlation: 
One variable increase as another variable incre
ases.
 Negative Correlation: 
One variable decreases as another variable increases.
 Correlation can sometimes be roughly approximated by viewing a graphical analysis of data in the form 

of a scatter diagram or X/Y plot.  The steps for creating such diagrams 
were covered in chapter 17. To 
understand how various types of correlation might appear graphically, consider the example scatter 
diagrams below.

   In the scatter diagram above, temperature has a 
strong positive correlation to time. This means that 

temp
erature in the process has a tendency to 
increase as time increases. The relationship is strong, 
because you could draw a best fit line, as seen in the 
image to the left, and it would touch almost every 
data point with minimal deviation of data points 
from
 the line.

    The diagram above features a strong 
negative correlation. This means that 
temperature in the process has a tendency 
to decrease as time increases. Again, you 
can draw a best fit line through the points 

of data and all of them remain very 
close 
to the trend line, as seen in the graph to 
the right. 
     In contrast, the graph to the left represents a set 

of data where correlation might be present, but it 
is weaker than either of the two examples above. 
Weak correlation is represented on a s
catter 
diagram where a trend line does seem to exist and 

where roughly the same number of data points 
that don™t touch the line are located above or 
below. Typically, the data points located above 
and below the trend lines are somewhat

 symmetrical, meaning
 that one side doesn™t feature points that are extremely far away from the line as 
compared to points on the other side, but this isn™t always the case. Weak correlation can be easy to 
see, as in this case, or more difficult to see on a graph, warranting t
he use of statistical analysis to make 
a strong case for correlation.
   The graph above shows a scatter diagram that indicates no or almost no correlation between time and 
temperature in a process. The data points are scattered randomly over the graph, an
d the trend line is 
almost horizontal. A horizontal trend line is usually an indication of a lack of correlation.
 The Correlation Coefficient 
 Images aren™t always accurate, especially when correlation is weak. And in some cases, an image 
capturing a small
 sample of data could show correlation or no correlation when correlation did exist in 
the overall sample or data set. Graphical analysis is useful to gain an idea about data relationships 
Œ and 
very useful for illustrating relationships to others 
Œ but st
atistical analysis helps teams understand 
relationships with more certainty.
 For the purpose of correlation, the statistical calculation we are concerned with is known as the 

correlation coefficient, or R value. The correlation coefficient is a number betw
een 
-1 and 1. As the 
correlation coefficient approaches either 
-1 or 1, a relationship between two variables is considered 
more likely or stronger.
  If the correlation coefficient is equal to 1, then the relationship is certain: all the data points on 
the s
et are found 
on the positive trend line.
  The same is true for a correlation coefficient that is equal to 
-1, except that all the data points 
are found 
on the negative trend line.

  A correlation coefficient equal to 0 means there is certainly no relationship
 between the 
variables, and there is no trend line.
  Most of the time, when you calculate correlation coefficients, the number will be between 0 
and 1 or 0 and 
-1.  Calculating Correlation Coefficient in Excel: Two Methods
 Correlation coefficients are calcu
lated using several formulas. One of the most common formulas used 
in basic statistics is Pearson™s correlation coefficient formula, which is shown below:
   Another calculation uses the sum of squares. The formula is shown below.
 = Where:
 =() =() =()()  Both of these formulas rely on the specific (x,y) data arrived at by combining data pairs. For example, 
consider the following data set:
 Months on Job
 Average Production
 2 10 2 11 3 12 3 11 Page | 
248
  © 201
8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 3 13 4 11 4 15 4 15 5 16 5 15 5 18  If average production is considered the Y axis and months on the job the X axis, paired points of this 
data set would be written as:
  2, 10
  2, 11
  3, 12
  3, 11
  And so forth
 Those numbers can then be 
included in the equations above; the sigma symbol (which looks like an E) 

indicates summing. In Pearson™s equation, you sum all of the (x*y) and subtract the (sum of all x)*(sum 
of all y) to arrive at the top number, for example.
 It is possible to calculat
e the correlation coefficient using one of these formulas, but luckily today™s 
technology provides digital methods for automatically calculating the number. You can use statistical 

analysis software or graphing calculators to arrive at the correlation coef
ficient given data about two 

variables in a process. In this section, we™ll look at two quick ways of determining correlation coefficients 
using Excel.
 For both exercises below, we™ll use the following data table. Copy the data table into a blank Excel 
wor
ksheet.

 11 63 31 71 64 12 65 25 55 59  CORREL Formula
 One of the easiest ways to calculate the correlation coefficient for two sets of possibly related data is to 
use Excel™s CORREL formula. Follow the steps below to calculate the correlation coefficient between 

time and Temperature A.
 1. In any c
ell in the worksheet where you copied the data table above, the formula =CORREL
  2. Array 1 is the set of cells containing data for time. Array 2 is the set of cells containing data for 

Temperature A. You can select these cell ranges with your mouse, separat
ing them with a 
comma in your formula. The end result should appear as follows.
   3. Hit enter.
 4. Excel will calculate the correlation coefficient. In this case, it is 0.981167422

 The correlation coefficient calculated above is for the data set that created 
the very first scatter diagram 
for this chapter. If you recall, the scatter diagram appeared to show that the data had a very strong 
positive correlation; a correlation coefficient (or R value) of 0.98 is certainly in line with that assessment.
 Let™s calcu
late the correlation coefficient for time and temperature C from the data table above. Repeat 
the steps above, but change your Array 2 range to reference the data set for temperature C.
  The R value for time and temperature C is calculated as 0.107, which
 is much closer to zero. This data set 
created the scatter diagram above that appeared to have no correlation. The R value corresponds with 
the conclusions drawn from the scatter diagram. 
In most applications, correlation is considered to occur 
at some 
level if the R value is 0.4 or more or 
-0.4 or less.
  Data Analysis ToolPak
 You can also use the Analysis ToolPak to calculate correlation coefficients. Follow the steps below to 

calculate the R value for time and Temperature B.
 1. Format your spreadsheet so 
that the Time and Temperature B columns are next to each other.
 2. Select Data and then Data Analysis from the top menu.
  3. Highlight Correlation and select OK.

 4. Click in the input box and select the inputs for the correlation analysis. Select the data from b
oth 
the time and temperature B columns.
 5. Note that your data is grouped by columns. If you selected the header rows in the input range, 
check the box for ﬁlabels in the first row.ﬂ 
 6. Opt to output in a new worksheet.
 7. Click 
OK. 8. Excel will calculate the corre
lation coefficient.
   In the above example, the R value shows a very strong negative correlation between time and 
temperature. This data set is the same set used to make the negative correlation scatter diagram above, 

so the R value is consistent with tha
t graphical analysis.
 Repeat the steps above to find the correlation coefficient of time and temperature D. 
  The R value returned shows a weaker positive correlation than in our first calculation using the CORREL 

function, but we would still consider the
se data correlated. The data for temperature D is the same data 
that created the third scatter diagram in the graphical analysis portion of this chapter.

 Linear Regression Analysis 
 Once you know your data has a linear correlation, you can conduct further 
analysis through regression 
testing. Regression lets you create a linear model that helps you predict how one variable might behave 
given changes in the other variable. Note again that the changes aren™t necessarily an indication of 
cause 
Œ only that the v
ariables are intertwined in some way.
 When working with regression, we talk about the coefficient of determination, or the r
2 value. The r
2 value is, literally, the square of R, or the square of the correlation coefficient. So, from our last example 
in the
 correlation coefficient section, R = 0.860624. The r
2 value in this case would be 0.74.
 The r
2 value is a number between 0 and 1. The number tells us about the strength of the linear 
relationship between two variables 
Œ x and y. While the R value tells us
 how likely it is that two values 
are related in some way, the r
2 value tells us how much the fluctuation in one variable (the dependent 
variable, or y) is related to changes in another variable (the independent variable, or x).
 In the example used above, 
r2 is 0.74. That means that approximately 74 percent of the variation in the 
temperature is related to the change in time; the other 26 percent variation in temperature is 
unexplained. 
 Regression analysis lets us create a best fit line and equation for ou
r data, and the r
2 value tells us how 
confident we can be in using that line to make predictions about data.
 Analyzing Regression Using the Data Analysis ToolPak
 To understand how regression works, consider the same data set used in the correlation coeffic
ient 
examples above:
 Time
 Temperature A
 Temperatur
e B Temperature C
 Temperature D
 1 30 70 35 30 2 35 68 48 31 3 37 63 75 38 4 40 62 25 24 5 41 55 50 35 6 48 47 34 49 7 57 42 48 45 8 55 41 31 59 9 59 38 24 42 10 62 36 41 65 11 63 31 71 64 12 65 25 55 59  If you recall, the correlation between time and temperature A was strong. We™ll look at that relationship 
on a regression model using the Analysis ToolPak in Excel.

 Excel generates a new workbook with a number of statistical outputs. The relevant values for t
he 
purpose of this chapter are found under ﬁMultiple Rﬂ and ﬁR Square.ﬂ 
  The Multiple R value is the correlation coefficient. You can see that the coefficient in this case matches 

the correlation coefficient calculated for this data set in the last secti
on. The r
2 value for this data set is 
0.96, which means almost all the variation in temperature in this data set is related to a change in time.
 Because you selected the line fit plots box when creating your regression analysis, Excel has also 

generated a 
scatter diagram and a best fit plot.

   In this case, the equation is y = 3.3497x + 27.561.
 The r
2 value, if you recall, is 0.96, which means that our linear equation is going to be very
 good at 
determining the approximate temperature in our process as a relation to time.
 At 5 minutes, for example, our equation predicts that the temperature is 44.30.
  Y = 3.3497(5) + 27.561
 At 25 minutes, our equation predicts that the temperature is 
111.30.
 Regression test with low correlation
 To see how regression tests might look with low correlation, repeat the steps above with the data for 
temperature C.

 Again, the correlation coefficient is very low. The r
2 value is also very low; according to
 this model, only 
about 1 percent of the variation in temperature is related to time. 
  If you format it to do so, Excel will create a predicted line and a linear trend equation. Given the 
extremely low r
2 value, though, you know that this equation is not
 useful in making any real predictions 
about the temperature for a given time. You only have to look at the graph to see this is true. For a time 
around 3, the equation predicts a temperature of just over 40. The actual temperature, however, was 
75. And th
at number doesn™t just reflect an outlier that might point to a problem of data collection or a 
temporary process issue; the data throughout the chart is skewed far away from the line.
  Using Correlation and Regression in Six Sigma
 Correlation and regressi
on are useful tools, usually deployed by teams in the measure, analyze, or 
improve stages of a DMAIC project. The tools don™t apply to all data and are not useful in all situations 
where they might apply. One of the things that a Six Sigma expert develops 
over time is the ability to 
decide 
which 
tools might be relevant given certain data and situations. Because Excel and other 
statistical analysis software make it easy for Six Sigma experts and teams to ﬁplayﬂ with data in various 
graphical and statistical 
analysis, there is no harm in creating correlation or regression analyses for data 
to explore connections between variables.  This is true as long as you are careful about what conclusions 
you draw. When in doubt, it™s always best to back conclusions up wi
th multiple types of statistical 
analysis.
 Continuous and ratio data
 Both correlation and regression work with continuous or ratio data, and both sets of variables have to 
be quantitative in nature. For example, you can™t have x variables that are the name
s of people and y 

variables that are the number of outputs.

 13  The above chart is an example of the type of data that would not apply to regression and correlation 
analysis, but 
might
 be analyzed using tools such as Pareto charts or pie charts.
 Correlation requires two quantifiable data elements. Regression requires data that can be written as 
function:
 y = f(x)
 Some examples of data that can be written as a function include:
  Distance
 o Y, the distance, is function of time, speed, acceleration, etc.
  Hardness of a substance
 o Y, the hardness, is a function of temperature, alloy, etc.
  Experienced (feels like) temperature
 o Y, the temperature it feels like, is a function of the actual temperatur
e, wind, humidity, 
etc.
  BMI (body mass index) 
 o Y, the BMI, is a function of height and weight 
 Why use correlation and regression?
 Correlation and regression can be applied by Six Sigma experts at a number of points in a DMAIC 
process. During the analyze p
hase, teams can use these tools to help verify relationships between inputs 
or to help bolster understanding of root cause analysis. While correlation and regression don™t prove 
causation, they don™t negate causation either. A strong correlation doesn™t pr
ove causation, but if a 
team already believes causation is a factor, then a strong regression model helps validate that 
assumption. This is especially true if a team couples regression modeling with trial
-and
-error hypothesis 
testing.
 For example, a Six 
Sigma team might conduct brainstorming and fishbone diagrams, coming to the 
conclusion that a certain input, A, is causing variation in an output, B. The team™s Six Sigma experts 
conduct regression testing, which shows that variation in B is definitely rel
ated strongly to variation in A. 
The team can remove A from the process 
Œ or alter A in some way 
Œ and measure the process again. The 
team can then use hypothesis testing
to determine if their changes created a sta
tistical difference in the 
output.

 An even more important function of regression in the DMAIC process is determining optimum input 
values so teams have a goal for control. Consider the example data used throughout this chapter. 
What 
if the team exploring 
this sample data was working with a process that involved mixing ingredients at a 
specific temperature range to create certain results
? If the continuous time a mixing machine runs 
causes temperature fluctuations, those fluctuations would create variation
 in the final product. If the 
team discovered that the temperature range 40 to 50 degrees correlated to the most optimal product 
output, then the team could use the equation provided by the regression model to determine at what 
time range the mixing machin
e should be operated.
 Consider the data for Temperature A again:
 Time
 Temperature 
A 1 30 2 35 3 37 4 40 5 41 6 48 7 57 8 55 9 59 10 62 11 63 12 65  Page |

  This data had both a strong correlation coefficient and a strong r
2 value, which means the 
team can rely 
on the equation for the best fit line.
 In this case, to find the time values relating to a range between 40 and 50 degrees, the team would 
solve for x when y = 40 and when y = 50.
 40 = 3.3497x + 27.561
 40 Œ 27.561 = 3.3497x
 12.439 = 3.3497x
 3.71 = x
 when y = 40
  50 = 3.3497x + 27.561
 50 Œ 27.561 = 3.3497x
 22.439 = 3.3497x
 6.69 = x when y = 50

 Using these results, the team decides that mixing must be done when the machine has been on 
between 3.71 and 6.69 minutes. They create a change in the 
process that involves starting the mixing 
procedure after the machine has warmed up for 4 minutes.

 Unit 5: Intermediate Statistics
 Chapter 20: Non
-Normal Probability 
Distributions
  In chapter 18, we discussed the normal probability curve, which is also
 called the Gaussian distribution. 
While it™s true that the normal probability curve is the most important and commonly used distribution 
in statistics and by Six Sigma teams, it™s also true that every set of data is not going to fall along the 
normal prob
ability distribution. This chapter covers non
-normal probability distributions, how to 
recognize some of the more common distributions through graphical analysis, and some information 

about using statistical analysis with such distributions.
 Some of the si
mpler statistical calculations for non
-normal probability distributions are included in this 
chapter, along with details for how to handle those calculations manually. Calculations for all of the 
distributions mentioned are not included, because they can b
e very complex and almost no one handles 
these calculations manually. In unit 6, we™ll cover how to calculate probabilities using a wide variety of 
distributions in Minitab.
 Reviewing Normal Probability Distributions
 Before moving forward, it™s important t
o revisit some of the fundamental information about the normal 
curve covered in chapter 18. First, remember that the normal distribution is related to 
continuous data
. This means that your data is associated with random variables that can take the form of 
any of an 
infinite number of points along an interval. Temperature over time is a continuous type of data. Yes, you 

might never see the temperature of a room fall below 40 degrees F, but within a range such as 40 

degrees and 80 degrees are an infinite numb
er of continuous data points if you measured to a high 
enough degree of accuracy. 
 Remember that 
discrete data
 is not continuous in nature. Discrete data is typically about categorical 
occurrences. In some cases, discrete data can be converted to continuou
s data to allow Six Sigma teams 
to use more statistical analysis tools when working with the information. When that isn™t possible, 
however, you cannot use the normal curve or related statistical analysis on discrete data. Discrete data 
usually involves ei
ther a binomial distribution or a Poisson distribution; both will be covered later in this 
chapter.
 Anatomy of a Normal Curve
 The normal curve, when presented in graphical format or on a histogram, is typically symmetrical in 
nature. The data elements tend
 to concentrate along the center of the curve, with elements fanning out 
slowly on either side as the curve drops ever toward zero. 
 While a visual inspection of data through graphical analysis can help determine if data might be normal, 
there are several 
continuous distribution curves that look a lot like normal curves. That™s why we apply 
statistical tests, such as the Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit Test discussed in chapter 18, to determine 
whether data is actually normal. Don™t confuse the Chi
-Squared 
Good
ness
-of
-Fit Test with the Chi

 Squared distribution, which makes an appearance later in this chapter. One is a statistical test and the 
other is a probability distribution.
 The normal curve:
  Is symmetrical
  Is most commonly required for inferential statistic
s  Is described statistically using both the mean and standard deviation
 o The curve centers on the mean
 o The number of standard deviations away from the mean changes the probability of the 

amount of data under the curve
  Non
-Normal Continuous Distributions
  Exponential Distribution
 The exponential distribution creates a histogram or trend line that is exponential in nature. It decreases 
exponentially as you travel across the x
-axis. See the image below for an example. 
   In an exponential distribution, the d
ata is not organized around the mean as in the normal probability 
curve, but at one end of the x
-axis. The data used to create the histogram above had a mean of 24.79 
but a median of 16. Often, when working with non
-normal data, the median is a more applic
able data 
point than the mean for graphical analysis. If you locate the median on the x
-axis of an exponential 
histogram, you know that 50 percent of the other data points fall before it and 50 percent after it. 
 Exponential distributions are often used wh
en working with data sets that include arrival times, the 
average or mean time between failures in a process, wait
-line theories, or the distance 
Œ in time or 
space 
Œ between interesting points of occurrence in data, processes, or experiments. The exponent

 distribution is particularly valuable when working with certain Poisson distributions. If you recall, 
Poisson distributions are discrete rather than continuous, which means Six Sigma teams are limited in 
what statistical tools can be used to analyze th
e data. However, the exponential distribution can often 
be used to describe the rate of change within the data that is distributed in a Poisson distribution, 
providing a method for creating continuous data that can be analyzed.
 The exponential curve:
  Never
 appears symmetrical
  Is described statistically by the mean of the data and a value known as lambda
  Here is another graphical representation of an exponential distribution generated in Minitab, which is a 
statistical analysis software.
   As with the norm
al distribution, you 
can run a statistical test in Excel to determine if your data is 
exponential. The test is basically the same Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit test we used in chapter 18. The 
same idea is used: you first predict the number of data points you
 would find in each bin in a perfect 
exponential curve given the statistical data regarding your set. You then compare the actual breakdown 
of your data against expected numbers to find the Chi
-Squared value, which is used to evaluate your 
hypothesis that 
the data is exponential.
 Because we are going to introduce using Minitab for statistical analysis functions in the next few 
units
, 
and because Minitab handles Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit testing and many other statistical 
calculations automatically, we won
™t cover detailed steps for testing each type of data distribution in 
Excel. Because most of the tests that can be performed using the free Analysis ToolPak in Excel require

 normally distributed data, the steps for testing for normal data in Excel in chapt
er 18 should be 
sufficient for much of your Excel
-only based work.
   Lognormal Distribution
 At first, the lognormal distribution might appear to be an exponential distribution, but on a graphical 
analysis, it is obviously constrained by zero. The lognormal
 distribution on a histogram is asymmetrical, 
with the trend line appearing more as a wave that moves across the page. The location and size of the 
wave varies with each data set, and the shape can even be very different from the one below. 
  Lognormal di
stributions are often used when working with data sets that describe time durations, such 
as the time a process or machine is down, or distribution of assets or wealth among the population. 
Anytime data has a positive skew, which means it the tail of the d
ata is to the right, then a lognormal 
distribution might be possible. Consider the example of wealth within a population. If we only consider 
the amount of income each household within a population reports, almost no household will report an 
income of zero
, and it™s impossible to have an income of 
less than
 zero. 
(Yes, you can have a net worth 
that is negative, and you can have a cash flow that is negative if you consider income and expenses, but 

for our example, we™re only discussing income.
) Now, in 
a random sample of income from across a large population 
Œ a city, for example
 -- data is likely 
to be lognormal. As you move further right in the bins on a histogram 
Œ representing increasing dollar 
figures of income 
Œ there are 
fewer 
households that will
 fall into each bin. As you reach the highest 
dollar bins, you™ll likely see the fewest households represented on a histogram. While the effect is 

similar to the positive exponential distribution seen above, there are some differences. The lognormal 
distri
bution of the wealth doesn™t typically begin with the highest number of data points in the first bin;

 more often, you™ll see a small number of or no data points in the first bin, followed by a quick rise to a 
median point, and then a sloping trail to the r
ight.
 The lognormal distribution:
  Typically describes a data set with values in large ranges
  Can be described with both mean and standard deviation
  Always has a positive skew
 Here is another image of a lognormal distribution, generated from Minitab.
  Weibull Distribution
 Just to make things more confusing, probabilities can fall into families of distributions, such as the 

Weibull distributions. Data that fits a Weibull distribution 
might also 
fit another distribution, including 
all of those discussed p
reviously in this chapter. Note that Weibull distributions relate to continuous 
data, so the data would not likely fit a discrete data distribution. 
 Look at the Weibull distributions below, which were created in Minitab. Do these images look familiar?

  The curves appear to fit the lognormal, exponential, and normal distributions, respectively, even though 
they each also fit the Weibull distribution.
 Weibull distributions can describe many data types and are often used when working with reliability 
app
lications and failure probabilities that change or vary with time. For example, the chance that a 
plasma screen will be damaged by burn
-in increases both over the time the screen is used 
and over the 
time that a single still image is displayed on a screen.
 Data associated with such a concern might feature 
a Weibull distribution.
 Other Types of Continuous Distributions
 As previously stated, you will commonly work with normal distributions when applying statistical 
analysis. Even if the underlying distributio
n of your data set is not normal, if you have a large, random 
sample of continuous data, you are usually able to perform statistical analyses that are reserved for 

normal data thanks to the 
Central Limit Theorem
. The Central Limit Theorem states that the d
istribution 
of the mean of a large, identically distributed number of independent variables will approximate the 

normal curve. Because of this, you™ll be able to use software like Minitab to apply statistical analysis to a 
number of data sets. 
 It™s still 
a good idea to be able to recognize common continuous distributions that are not normal, 
including those listed above. In this section, we™ll highlight a few other non
-normal continuous 
distributions and provide images.
 Cauchy Distribution
 In a graphical r
epresentation, the Cauchy distribution often looks like an elongated normal curve with a 
tighter peak. While the Cauchy distribution does share some characteristics with the normal curve, the 
1.81.61.41.21.00.80.60.40.20.01.61.41.21.00.80.60.40.20.0XDensityDistribution PlotWeibull, Shape=4, Scale=1, Thresh=0Page |

 data itself is not normal. In fact, the distribution doesn™t hav
e a defined mean or variance, which makes 
it not useful for many common statistical analysis tools used in Six Sigma. 
  Logistic Distribution
 The logistic distribution also appears to approximate the normal curve, and is, in fact, used in some 
science and
 math functions to approximate other symmetrical distributions. This is because the CDF of a 
logistic distribution is more consistently calculable. Remember that the CDF is the cumulative density 
function and calculates the probability that a given data po
int is less than or equal to X, where X is any 
point on the x
-axis of a probability curve.

  Laplace Distribution
 The Laplace Distribution is often referred to as the bilateral exponential distribution or the double
-exponential distribution. You can see fr
om the image below, the Laplace distribution does seem to pair 
exponential distributions back to back.

  Uniform Distribution
 A uniform distribution occurs when data points are divided evenly among bins. Exact uniform 
distributions are almost never going 
to occur in randomly
-sampled data, which means Six Sigma teams 
that see such distributions in data should check the authenticity of the data. Uniformity often points to 
an error of measurement, problem with the measurement system, a non
-random sample, or a
n issue 
with a process. 
 In some very specific cases, uniform distributions 
could
 point to success. For example, in a 
manufacturing plant, one machine might make dowels that are used later in the manufacturing process. 
If the dowels must measure 4 inches for functionality later, and a random sampling of dowels across all 

time buckets f
or the machine show 4
-inch dowels being made, then uniformity equals success.

  Beta Distribution
 Like Weibull distributions, Beta distributions can take on a number of shapes, two of which are pictured 
below. Beta distributions are considered extremely fl
exible, and can become stand
-ins for other 
distributions given certain statistical parameters.

 Gamma
 Gamma distributions are similar to Beta and Weibull distributions, in that they take on a number of 
shapes. In fact, some distributions that aren™t co
vered in this chapter are actually just more specific 
forms of the Gamma distribution. Gamma distributions are, however, always skewed to the right.

mits of a data set.

  Non
-Normal Discrete Distributions
  Binomial Distribution
 A binomial distribution is used when you are dealing with discrete data and there are only two 
outcomes for each trial or sample. In short, binomial distributions relate to att
ribute data: Yes or no, 
pass or fail, one or the other. 
 A binomial distribution assumes that the outcome of any given trial is independent of the outcome of 

another trial. If you flip a coin, it will either be heads or tails. If you flip it again, it agai
n will be heads or 

tails, with a 50 percent probability for either outcome. It doesn™t matter what happened with the first 
flip of the coin. 
 In most cases when considering attribute outcomes, the probability is not distributed evenly between 
the two event
s, as it is with a coin flip. Instead, there is a probability of success (notated as p) and a 
probability of failure (notated as 1 
Œ p). For example, if a machine making parts creates defects in 5 
percent of the parts, then you have two outcomes for each p
art made. Either the part will be defective, 
or it will not be defective.
 For this example, p (the outcome that the part will be defective) equals 0.05, and 
1 Œ p (the outcome 
that the part will not be defective) is 0.95. If you select one random part,
 the chance of getting a 
defective part is 0.05.
 (It™s worth noting before moving on the seeming discrepancy in the above two paragraphs. First, we said 
that the probability of success was notated as p. Then, we said that the probability of pulling a defec
tive 
part is p, or 0.05. In business terms, pulling a defective part would not be deemed a success. However, 
in 

statistical terms,
 we are not talking about the quality nature of the outcome. We are talking about 
whether an outcome will successfully match t
he definition we have created. In this case, whether the 
outcome will be defective.)
 The Binomial distribution of the data described above on a histogram might appear as follows:
 Page | 
279

   When you are dealing with binomial data sets, you can use the Binomial Distribution Probability 
Function to determine the probability of the number of successes you will have within a given number 
of trials 
given the sample data
 you have. The answers gener
ated by the Binomial Distribution Probability 
Function correlate to the histogram generated by Minitab given the same information.
 To understand what we mean by this, let™s consider the example of the coin toss again. For this example, 

imagine a coin is to
ssed 10 times, and we consider heads to be success. The chance of success (heads) 
for each coin flip is 0.5. Given that information, Minitab creates the histogram below.

  This graph shows us that, if we toss the coin 10 times, the chance of getting 1 succ
ess in all those 10 
tosses is very small 
Œ as is the chance of getting 9 successes. The chance of getting 5 successes out of 10 
is much higher 
Œ but not actually 50 percent.
 To apply this concept to a real
-world situation, let™s look again at our machine p
rocess, which produces 
defective parts at a rate of 0.05. Again, the histogram below illustrates the data that might occur if we 
took 20 random samples from the process.

  The probability that we will have 0 successes (defective parts) in our sample of 20
 is a bit over 0.35. The 
probability that we will have 1 defective part is a bit higher, but the chance that we™ll have five defective 
parts in 20 is very, very small. The probability of more than 5 defective parts in our batch of 20 is almost 
nonexistent.
  What does this tell a real
-world Six Sigma team? Imagine a quality control team took 20 random samples 
from this process every day. For two weeks straight, the quality team records no defects within those 

samples. If the Six Sigma team believes a process
 generates 0.05 defective parts, then a lack of defective 
parts in the samples shows that (1) something has changed to improve the performance of the process, 

(2) the measurement system is defective, or (
3) the samples are not actually random.
 If you incre
ase the number of trials to 100, the binomial distribution remains.

  Here, you can see that the greatest likelihood for this process is that, within 100 samples, 4 or 5 will be 
defective. It is unlikely, given a defect rate of 0.05, that a random sample o
f 100 would ever have more 
than 11 or 12 defective parts.
 What we have done graphically, you can also do mathematically using the Binomial Distribution 
Probability Function. The equation is provided below.
 ()=!!()!   For this formula:
  x is equal to the number of successes desired
  n is equal to the number of trials
  p is equal to the probability of success in each trial
  q is equal to 
1 Œ p  The exclamation point indicates a factorial. 
 o 3! = 3x2x1 = 6
 o 4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24
 o 5! = 5x4x3x2x1 = 120
 Using the Binomial Distribution Probability Function, we can calculate the probability that 20 trials will 

yield 4 defective parts in a process that delivers 0.05 defective parts.

 Consider a company that sells chocolates. If 20 chocolates come in each box, what is the chance that a 
customer might receive defective product in
 his or her box? What is the chance that a customer might 
receive more than one defective chocolate? Teams can calculate these probabilities after sampling data 
to determine how often a process generates defective product.
 What if a Six Sigma team randomly
 samples the chocolate process and determines that the process 
operates at a 4
-sigma level. Remember from Unit 1 that at 4 sigma, a process generates 6,210 defects 
per million opportunities. Let™s assume that means 6,210 defective chocolates per million cr
eated, or a 
chance of a chocolate being defective equal to 0.00621.
 In a box of 20 chocolates, with p = 0.00621, Minitab generates the following binomial histogram.
  From the above histogram, you can see that the likelihood of a box having no defective chocolates is 

approximately 88 percent. The likelihood of a box having one defective chocolate is approximately 10 

percent. The likelihood of a box having two or more de
fective chocolates is almost nonexistent. 
 What does this mean for the business? It depends on the goals of the business or the Six Sigma project. 
If the Six Sigma team was tasked with improving customer satisfaction or decreasing the rate of return 
of cho
colate boxes, then a 10 percent probability of a defective chocolate in a box might be something 
the team wants to address. However, if customer satisfaction is strong and return costs are low, then 
the potential complaints or returns associated with a sma
ll number of boxes might be acceptable to the 
business 
Œ particularly if a Six Sigma team discovers that reducing the error rate would cost well over the 
amount that it costs to handle the errors.
 By applying the binomial distribution in this manner to pas
s/fail, yes/no, or defect/no defect, Six Sigma 
teams can calculate data that is useful in a variety of real
-world situations. The ability to tie costs to

 defects make
s it even more possible to evaluate this type of information using binomial probability, 
because teams can speak in terms of the probability that different processes or outcomes will cost 
varying amounts of money 
Œ or save varying amounts of money 
Œ both of which are metrics company 
leadership will be interested in hearing.
   Poisson Distributi
on The Poisson distribution is often used when dealing with data that is distributed randomly within time, 
distance, or other unit of measurement. For example, the distribution might be relevant when dealing 
with calls per hour in a call center, traffic ac
cidents per week on a specific block or street, or number of 
defects in a batch. In fact, the word ﬁperﬂ in a metric is a good indication that the Poisson distribution 
might be useful.
 As you can see from the graph before, the Poisson distribution can look
 a little like the normal curve, but 
it is not symmetrical. This curve, based off a mean of 4, tails slightly to the right.

 This graph of a Poisson distribution with a mean of 42 looks even more like the normal curve. If you look 
very close, however, and count the bins to the left and right of the mean, you see that the curve tails 
very slightly to the right. This is a good exa
mple of why statistical analysis is needed in addition to 
graphical analysis when working with data. Data can approximate the normal curve on a graph without 
being normal. 
   One interesting thing to note about the Poisson distribution is that it relates 
closely to the exponential 
distribution. Remember, the Poisson distribution is discrete, not continuous. The distribution is an 
analysis of how many of one thing occurs per another. For example, consider the number of errors in a 

data entry employee™s work
 each hour.

 The data isn™t continuous. Instead, it is categorical. How many errors does the employee make in hour 
1, 
hour 2, hour 3, and so forth. However, if the process is following a Poisson distribution, then the time 
between each event in the process when looked at continuously yields an exponential distribution. 
Understanding this relationship can help Six Sigma
 teams convert Poisson distributions to exponential 
distributions when necessary for statistical analysis. The use of this conversion within a Six Sigma 
environment is not likely to be common for most teams, but could be useful in special applications 
Œ some of which we™ll cover in the industry
-specific sections at the end of this book.
 The Poisson distribution might be applicable when the following statements can be used to describe 

your data:
  Data describes events that occur at a random interval 
measurement 
Œ the word ﬁperﬂ is usually 
involved.
  The sample size (number of intervals) is at least 16. If you are measuring per hour, you have at 
least 16 hours™ worth of data. If you are measuring per foot, you have at least 16 feet of data.
  You know tha
t the population size is 10 times the size of the sample or bigger. If you are 
measuring worker productivity, for example, you can™t take the first 16 hours the worker is on 
the job.
  Event occurrences are independent of each other. In our data
-entry exampl
e, if we are counting 
each unnecessary keystroke as an error, we might count the backspace. However, the backspace 
is dependent on the person making another error. If the person types ﬁbﬂ when he or she meant 
ﬁn,ﬂ that™s one error. If we count the backspac
e as error 2, then the errors are not independent.
  The probability of occurrences 
is 
less than 0.1. Consider the data
-entry example above. When 
using a 10
-key number pad, the average rate of entry for employees in the United States is 
approximately 8,000 p
er hour. If an employee is making 8 
Œ 12 errors an hour, the probability of 
an error for each keystroke is well below 0.1.
  The rate of occurrence per interval is constant. The average number of phone calls per hour is 
50; the average number of errors per h
our is 6.
  If data fits the Poisson distribution, you can use an equation to determine the probability of certain 
events. 
 The Poisson equation is:

   is the specific case or data point; remember that the exclamation point indicates a factorial. 
  For example, if a Six Sigma team was working to improve processes in a call center, they might have 
gathered data that indica
tes the average number of people on hold for a customer service 
representative at any given time is 10. Given that information and a Poisson distribution when 
considering number of holds per increments of time, the team can use the Poisson equation to calc
ulate 
probabilities related to various call scenarios.
 What is the probability that there are 15 callers on hold at a given time?

 ()=45,400,235,147.37341,307,674,368,000  ()=0.034  The probability of having exactly 15 callers on hold at a given time in the call center is 0.034, or 
approximately 3.4 percent. 
 That number in itself isn™t extremely helpful to a business or Six Sigma team unless there is a specific 
protocol or process problem that occurs 
only
 when call holds hit exactly 15. It™s not an extremely likely 
scenario. 
However, what if a Six Sigma team h
as noted that when the number of callers on hold hit
s 15 
or above, a regularly staffed call center team is unlikely to catch up, resulting in continued high hold 
times and volumes. 
Knowing this, the team might inform the process owner that when hold number
s hit 
15, it™s time to move some resources from other areas to answering calls.
 But how does a process owner or Six Sigma team plan appropriately? Do other resources need to 
constantly be on hand? Is the probability of this situation occurring high or low?
 To answer the question, you can use the Poisson equation to find the probability of there being 0, 1, 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 callers on hold at any given time. Because the probability of all 
possible outcomes totals to 1, you would
 subtract the sum of all those probabilities from 1 to determine 
the probability of the number of holds being 15 or more.
 Mathematically, the concept is written as:
 (15
)=1(0)+(1)+(2) +(3) +(4) +(5) +(6) +(7) +(8) +(9) +(10
) +(11
)+(12
)+(13
)+(14
)       To manually calculate the above probability, you would have to use the Poisson equation for each P(x) 
listed above. You can also use statistical analysis software, such as Minitab, to make the calculations for 
you. We™ll cover ho
w to handle such analysis in Minitab in later chapters. For now, though, consider the 
chart below, which shows the probability of each x.

   Summing the probabilities for each X provides a total probability that x will be less than 15 of 0.916541. 
 Alternatively, you can use statistical software to determine the 
cumulative probability 
Œ the area under 
the curve to the left of a certain point. The cumulative probabilities of x being less than or equal to 14 is 
0.916541.
 Therefore, the probability of x being 15 or greater is 1 
Œ 0.916541, or 0.083459.
 The probabilit
y that there are 15 or more callers on hold at any given time is about 0.083, or just over 8 
percent. Given this probability, call center leadership can make a more educated decision about 
whether they want to pay for more staff or take a risk at hitting t
he higher call volume and having to 
play catch up for the rest of the shift.
 Teams can use the Poisson distribution and calculations in this manner to understand the probabilities 
of different events occurring. They can also tie financial data to such 
events to make even better data
-driven decisions.
  Other Types of Discrete Distributions
 Geometric Distribution
 The
 geometric distribution is used when there are two outcomes for a trial, trials are independent, and 
there is a waiting time before the first occurrence. As with the binomial distribution, the outcome of 

each trial must be independent. A real
-world use of 
the geometric distribution might include the 
number of inspections that occur before finding a defective part or the number of resumes or 
applications a recruiter reviews before finding the first candidate that meets minimal job requirements. 
 An example o
f the geometric distribution is seen below.

  Negative Binomial
 The negative binomial distribution is also used with attribute data 
Œ fail/pass and other situations where 
there are only two outcomes for each trial. Again, the outcomes must be independent o
f each other; the 
probability of an occurrence must be the same across each trial, just as with the binomial distribution. 
The negative binomial distribution is often used when teams are trying to determine the probability of a 
certain number of passes or 
fails before reaching the s
th pass or fail.

   Applying Data to Real
-World Situations
 Throughout this chapter, we™ve touched on some ways that probability distributions let Six Sigma teams 
apply raw data about processes to real
-world concerns and situation
s. As previously stated, many of the 
statistical 
analyses 
you will perform on data will be related to the normal curve. But understanding a 
few equations related to distributions such as Binomial or Poisson helps you expand your ability to 
create real
-worl
d assumptions about data.
 When you can determine the probability for certain events or data points, you can make educated 
decisions about a process. What is the probability that a cost
-heavy event will occur? Is the cost 
associated with an event enough to 
create a reason for working to reduce the likelihood of that event? If 
the probability of a low
-cost defect is high, are the total expenses associated with that defect likely to be 
higher than the total expenses associated with a high
-cost defect that has 
an extremely low probability? 
These are just some of the questions that teams can use statistics and probability distributions to 
answer.

 Chapter 21: Hypothesis Testing
  Hypothesis tests are statistical tools used to draw conclusions based on data. With 
a basic 
understanding of the process and process performance, as well as real
-time data 
Œ or as close to real
-time data as possible 
Œ Six Sigma teams can draw statistical conclusions that are extremely accurate if 
they (1) ensure that the measurement syste
ms are good, (2) have the right sample size, and (3) know 
how to set up the right type of hypothesis test.
 Measurement systems analysis was discussed in Chapter 13. In this chapter, we™ll talk about different 
types of hypothesis tests, how to set them up, 
and how to read the results. In Chapter 22, we™ll cover 
how to choose the right sample size for various data types and hypothesis tests, and in the chapters on 
Minitab, you™ll find a step
-by
-step guide for running tests in the software program. You can als
o run 
some tests in Excel using the Analysis Toolpak you previously downloaded.
 Hypothesis Test Basics
 Hypothesis tests cover three broad categories:
  Testing whether the data you have fits a data model. In Chapter 18, we conducted a hypothesis 
test to dete
rmine whether data fit the normal curve. We used the Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit 
Test, but ultimately, it was a hypothesis test.
  Comparing a statistic to a hypothesis about the data or population.  
  Answering the question whether something changed within t
he data, often after a team has 
modified an input or other part of the process. In the case of most Six Sigma projects, the team 
probably wants to find out whether the process or outcome is improved.
 While the type of hypothesis test you use depends on the
 answers you are seeking and the type of data 
you have, all of the tests follow essentially the same guidelines
:  You begin with a statistic or criteria that you usually compute from your sample data
  You create a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis,
 in keeping with the type of test you 
are dealing with
 o Remember, in chapter 18 when we ran the Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit Test:
  The null hypothesis was that the data was normal
  The alternate hypothesis was that the data was not normal
  The statistic or cri
teria is compared against a reference criteria or distribution
  How the calculated statistic compares to the reference criteria determines whether you accept 
the null hypothesis or reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis
  Hypothesi
s tests are 
a large
 part of inferential statistics, where we draw conclusions about the overall 
process or population by analyzing the sample data and measurements. When stating 
hypotheses
, we 
are not making statements about the sample. We are making st
atements about the population or entire 

process.

 A hypothesis is ﬁthe population mean is 5.ﬂ
 We don™t need to make a hypothesis about the sample mean 
Œ we can calculate the sample mean.
 Null Versus Alternative
 Hypothesis tests have two main parts: 
the null
 hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.
 The null hypothesis is abbreviated as H
0 and is usually a statement about the data that reflects no effect 
or no difference. In chapter 18, we hypothesized that our data was normal. In effect, we were saying 
ﬁthe
re is no statistical difference between the distribution of our data and the distribution of data on a 
normal curve.ﬂ
 The alternative hypothesis is abbreviated as H
a and is usually a statement that is likely to be true if the 
null hypothesis is not true. I
n chapter 18, the alternative hypothesis was ﬁthere 
is a statistical difference 
between the distribution of our data and the distribution of data on a normal curve.ﬂ In short, if we 
reject the null hypothesis, we accept the alternative hypothesis 
Œ in this
 case, that our data is not 
normal.
 Typically, the null hypothesis is an equal statement of some type. The mean of the new process is equal 

to the mean of the new process. The distribution of the data is equal to the normal curve.
 The alternative hypothesi
s is typically written as a not equals, a greater than, or a less than statement. 
The mean of the new process is greater than the mean of the old process. The distribution of the data is 
not equal to the normal curve. How you write the alternative hypothes
is depends on the question you 
are asking and the type of hypothesis test you are running.
 The Risk of Hypothesis Testing Error
 Anytime you draw inferences about a population from sample data, there is at least some likelihood of 
error. With hypothesis tes
ting, errors come in two types.
  Type I Error: 
The null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. 
 o Also called producer risk
 o The probability of the risk is measured by alpha, where 
 is a probability between 0 and 
1.  Type II Error
: The null 
hypothesis is accepted when it is actually false.
 o Also called the consumer risk
 o The probability of the risk is measured by beta, where 
 is a probability between 0 and 
1. 
 To describe the risk 
Œ and set 
up 
our hypothesis test for what we deem to be an acc
eptable risk, a 
confidence level must be picked. The most common confidence level used is 95 percent, or 
=0.05
. Typically, the confidence level is set with the Type I error in mind, so you use alpha for the confidence 

level. The value of 
 then contribu
tes to the sample size requirements and the power; sample size will 
be covered in the next chapter. Additional information about alpha and beta values is covered in the 
section in this chapter on running individual hypothesis tests.

 Selecting the Right Hy
pothesis Test
 To determine which hypothesis test to run, you must know:
  Which 
type of data you have (continuous/variable or discrete/attribute)
  The number of levels of interest for the input in question (1, 2, or more than two)
  Distribution of data (normal
 or non
-normal)
  What you are testing (means, medians, variance, count, or proportions)
 In this chapter, the hypothesis tests that are covered deal with 1 or 2 levels of interest. 
 In the following section, we™ll introduce various types of hypothesis tests. Then, we™ll walk through 
running some of these tests using statistical s
oftware. 
 Hypothesis Tests for Discrete Data
  1-Proportion Test
  Used when there is only one factor for x
  Used when there is one level of interest for x (the input)
 o Typically, there is one set of data (the sample) and a target 
  Used when comparing proportio
ns (
percent
age
, rates) between samples and a target
  Test is available in Minitab
 o Requires samples in columns 
or summary of data to include number of events, number 
of trials, and hypothesized proportion
 The hypothesis test is set up as:
  H0 :  Psample
 = Ptarget
  Ha : Psample 
 Ptarget
 Note that in the above 
set
-up, the alternative hypothesis is set in a default to ﬁnot
-equal.ﬂ Minitab 
allows you to adjust the alternative hypothesis to a greater than or less than scenario if desired.
 Example of the 
1-Proportion Test:
 A school administrator believes that the students in a certain classroom are being impacted by some 
environmental issue with that room. The administrator wants to see if the students in that room 
perform statistically lower on tests than
 the students throughout the school; she has already noted that 
different classes in that room are taught by other teachers who also teach in the other rooms, which 

means she has ruled out a teacher influence.
 The administrator gathers data. The rate of fa
ilure for classes taught in any other classroom is 20 
percent. Out of 142 students who have a class in the classroom in question, 38 are failing that particular 
class. 
 The hypothesis test would be written out with both a real
-world statement and a statist
ical statement 
for both the null and alternative hypothesis.

  H0: There is no difference in the failure rate between the classes taught in the specific classroom 
and those taught elsewhere.
 o Pclassroom

 o   Ha: The rate of failure i

 o  2 Proportion Test
  Used when there is only one factor for x
  Used when there are 2 levels of interest for x (the input)
 o Typically, there are two sets of d
ata regarding the input and you are comparing those 
two sets of data
  Used when comparing proportions (
percentage
, rates) between samples or between samples 
and a target
  Test is available in Minitab
 o Requires samples in columns 
 The hypothesis test i
s set up as:
  H0 :  P1 = P2  Ha : P1  P2 Note that in the above 
set
-up, the alternative hypothesis is set in a default to ﬁnot
-equal.ﬂ Minitab 
allows you to adjust the alternative hypothesis to a great
er than or less than scenario if desired.
 Example of 
the 2
-Proportion Test:
 Reconsider the example above about the school administrator and the classroom. Perhaps the school 
administrator determines that students in that classroom 
do in fact perform statistically differently from 
students in other classrooms
. The administrator makes a decision to move the students in that 
classroom to another classroom. She then gathers data about test performance in the new classroom.
 Now, the administrator has two sets of test performance data for the same students. The onl
y variable 
that has changed is the classroom location. She wants to know, is there a difference between 

performance in the old room versus the new room?  
  H0: There is no difference in the failure rate between the old room and the new room.
 o Pold
 = Pnew
  Ha: The rate of failure is less in the new classroom.
 o Pold

 Hypothesis Test
s for Continuous Normal Data
  1-Sample T Test (or Paired T Test)
  Used when comparing means
  Typically used when dealing with smaller samples or when standard deviation is known.
 o When dealing with larger samples or when standard deviation is not known, use the 1
-Sample Z
-Test.
  1-Sample T Test compares the mean of a sample to a target mean
  Paired T Test compares the mean of a sample against the mean of another sample for the same 
factor of X. Usually, the first sample is the baseline and the second sample is taken after a 
change is made; the test is run to see if the change made a difference.
  1-Sample T Test is available in Minitab
 o Requires standard deviation, mean, and sample size 
as well as the target, or 

hypothesized mean.
  Paired T Test is available in Minitab and Excel™s Analysis TookPak 
 The hypothesis test is set up as:
  H0 :  1= 2  Ha :  1   2 Note that in the above 
set
-up, the alternative hypothesis is set in a 
default to ﬁnot
-equal.ﬂ Minitab 
allows you to adjust the alternative hypothesis to a great
er than or less than scenario if desired.  
 Example of the 1
-Sample T Test
 An agriculture company growing corn produced an average of 168 bushels of corn per acre 
each year for 

five years. The company made a change to its seeding process in an attempt to increase the yield of its 
fields. The harvest following the seed change resulted in an average of 175 bushels of corn per acre each 
year. Did the seeding change res
ult in a statistically different outcome in yield per acre?
  H0: There is no difference between the outcome after the seeding change and the outcome 
before it.
 o old
= new
  Ha: The seeding change resulted in an increase in the average amount yielded per fie
ld.
 o old
< new
  Chi Square Test (or 1
-Variance Test)
  Used when comparing standard deviation or variance
  Compares the standard deviation or variance between two samples of the same x factor (usually 
one sample is taken after a change to the process has be
en made) or compares the standard 
deviation or variance to a target or hypothesized statistic.
  Is available in Minitab

 o Requires sample data in two columns or summary data to include sample size with 
either sample standard deviation or sample variance 
and
 a hypothesized standard 
deviation or variance.
  The hypothesis test is set up as:
  H0 :   1= 2  Ha :  1   2 Note that in the above 
set
-up, the alternative hypothesis is set in a default to ﬁnot

allows you to adjust the alternative 
hypothesis to a great
er than or less than scenario if desired.  
 Example of the Chi
-Square Test (or 1
-Variance Test)
 A manufacturing plant makes the wheels that are put on dolly carts. The plant provides three sizes of 
wheels to a partner plant, which make
s the dolly itself and uses the wheels to complete the process. The 
partner plant makes a complaint: The smallest wheels coming from the factory have enough variation in 
size to cause stability problems with the final product, resulting in defective dollie
s or wasted wheel 
parts.
 The wheel
-making plant launches a Six Sigma improvement project to reduce the variation of the size in 
the smallest wheels. The team measures for a baseline and finds that the standard deviation in the size 

of the wheels is 0.0409.
 The team makes changes to the process and measures again to compare the 
new standard deviation to the old.
   H0: There is no difference between the standard deviations; the changes did nothing to 
statistically reduce the variation in the process.
 o  new
= 0.0409
  Ha: The improvements reduced the standard deviation in the process.
 o new
< 0.0409
  2-Sample T Test
  Used when comparing means
  Compares the means between two samples of the different x factors
  Is available in Minitab and Excel
 o Requires sample data in 
two columns or summary data to include sample size, sample 
mean, and standard deviation for both samples
  Requires you to note whether equal variances between the two samples are assumed or not
 The 2
-Sample T Test might seem like the 1
-Sample T Test, becaus
e in the 1
-Sample T Test, we discussed 
how you might compare a sample from before a change to a sample from after a change. However, the 
2-Sample T Test is slightly different, because you are comparing two samples from different populations. 
For example, y
ou might compare the mean body temperature for children who didn™t receive the 
influenza vaccine to mean body temperature for children who 
did
 receive the vaccine. This is different

 than comparing mean body temperature for the same group of children from l
ast year, when they didn™t 
receive the vaccine, to this year, when they did receive the vaccine. The first example would use the 2
-Sample T Test; the second (year
-over
-year) example would use the 1
-Sample T Test.
  The hypothesis test is set up as:

set

allows you to adjust the alternative hypothesis to a great

 Example of the 2
-Sample T 
Test
 Two attorneys practicing in the same law firm are turning in very different amounts of billable hours, 

even though the partners note that the two lawyers have similar caseloads. One partner hypothesized 
that Attorney A™s legal staff is taking too long
 to handle some tasks; because the firm bills at a certain 
time for administrative
-style tasks regardless of how long those tasks take, if legal staff is taking too long 
for such tasks, they are spending time on work that can™t be billed for.
 To test the t
heory, data is gathered about the time legal staff spends on tasks. Specifically, a team looks 
at time spent on three tasks for which the legal staff is allowed to bill 15 minutes each: certain types of 
simple administrative phone, copying, or filing tasks
.     H0: There is no difference between the average time Attorney A™s staff takes and the average 
time Attorney B™s staff takes for such tasks.
 o H0 :  AttorneyA
= AttorneyB
   Ha: Attorney B™s staff takes, on average, less time for these tasks.

 Consider the real estate company example above again. Now, imagine that the real estate company has 
limited resources, so they can only launch a campaign for one neighborhood at a time.
 To maximize 
potential results of their first campaign, the company wants to choose the neighborhood with the 
highest number of bedrooms in the highest number of homes.
 The company gathers information about homes in two neighborhoods. They then compare the
 samples 
to determine whether one sample has a statistically higher median number of bedrooms.

 Why Run Hypothesis Tests
 At this point, a common question about hypothesis tests comes up: Why go through the trouble to run 
statistical tests to determine if things are different? 
 Consider the example problem presented for the 1
-Sample T Test:
 An agriculture company growing corn
 produced an average of 168 bushels of corn per acre each year for 
five years. The company made a change to its seeding process in an attempt to increase the yield of its 
fields. The harvest following the seed change resulted in an average of 175 bushels o
f corn per acre each 
year. Did the seeding change result in a statistically different outcome in yield per acre?
 The question is: Is the mean corn yield per acre statistically higher following the seed change? Just 
looking at the numbers presented in this 
problem, we can see that the mean following the seed change 
is 175. When you compare that to 168, it is obviously higher. Why would we go through the trouble of 
setting up and running a hypothesis test?
 When introducing the normal curve in chapter 18, we n
oted that it™s not always enough to see that a 
histogram appears to be symmetric and following the normal curve. Raw data can be deceptive, which is 
why we ran the Chi
-Squared 
Goodness
-of
-Fit test in Excel to ensure the data was normal. The same 
principle 
is true when comparing statistics from samples. Yes, 175 is higher than 168. But in the case of 
the corn yield 
Œ is it 
statistically different
?  Six Sigma teams can™t just answer the question ﬁIs this number different?ﬂ They must answer the 
question ﬁIs th
is number so statistically different that we can take action on this information?ﬂ 
Statistically different doesn™t have to do with scale. In one process, the difference between 10 and 23 
might not be statistically different. In another, the difference betw
een 10 and 10.5 might be statistically 
different.
 Running Hypothesis Tests
  Page |

8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 To run a hypothesis test, you typically follow the same series of steps:
 1. State the null and alternative hypothes
es. The null hypothesis is always written from the 
perspective that 
no change or difference occurs or is present. The alternative hypothesis is 
always written from the perspective that a change or difference is present 
Œ either not equal, 
greater than, or less than.
 2. Set the confidence level for alpha. Usually, the confiden
ce level is set at 95 percent for alpha, 
but other common settings are 99 and 99.9 percent. A confidence level of 95 percent means an 
alpha value of 0.05; a confidence interval level of 99 percent means an alpha value of 0.01; a 

confidence interval of 99.9
 percent means an alpha value of 0.001.
 3. Decide which hypothesis test you are going to use. Use the information in the above section to 

find the appropriate test based on:
 a. The type of data you have
 b.
 The statistic you are dealing with (mean, variation, etc
.) c. How many sets of data you have (level of interest in x)
 d.
 Remember, testing more than two sets of data is covered in Unit 7 on Design of 

Experiments and ANOVA
 4. Decide whether your sample size is fixed or whether you can select a sample sized based on 
your bet
a setting. Setting sample size is covered in Chapter 22.
 5. Run the test in Minitab. Specific steps for each hypothesis test 
Œ as well as other Minitab 
functions 
Œ are covered in Unit 6.
 6. Interpret the p
-value against your alpha setting, which tells you whethe
r or not to reject the null 
hypothesis.
 7. Translate the statistical analysis into real
-world, business
-relevant language.
  For each statistical test, the calculations 
Œ handled automatically for us in Minitab or other software 
programs 
Œ return several value
s. Some calculations, such as the Chi
-Squared tests
, 
return specific 
statistics. In the case of the Chi
-Square
d tests, that statistic is the Chi
-Squared value. These statistics can 
be valuable in applications and analyses, but for the purpose of hypothesis
 testing, we are primarily 
concerned with the p
-value. The p
-value is returned for each test, and we compare the p
-value to the 
alpha value we set before we ran the test.
 If the p
-value returned for a test is 
less than
 the alpha value you set, then you rej
ect the null hypothesis 
and accept the alternative hypothesis. If the p
-value returned is 
more than
 the alpha value you set, then 
you fail to reject the null hypothesis and you do reject the alternative hypothesis.
 Above, we talked about setting a confiden
ce interval for alpha. If the confidence interval is 95 percent, 
then the alpha value is 0.05. Given a p
-value of 0.02, we would reject the null hypothesis and accept the 
alternative. Given a p
-value of 0.13, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis and
 would
 reject the 
alternative.
 Hypothesis Test Examples
 We™ll go through the steps for setting up and evaluating hypothesis tests using some of the example 
tests from the section above.

 1-Proportion Test
 Problem: A school administrator believes that the students in a certain classroom are being impacted by 
some environmental issue with that room. The administrator wants to see if the students in that room 
perform statistically lower
 on tests than the students throughout the school; she has already noted that 
different classes in that room are taught by other teachers.
 The administrator gathers data. The rate of failure for classes taught in any other classroom is 20 
percent. Out of 1
42 students who have a class in the classroom in question, 38 are failing that particular 
class. 
 Step 1: State Null and Alternative Hypothesis
 H0: There is no difference between the failure rate of students in the classroom and those in other 
classrooms.
 Ha: The failure rate of students in the classroom is statistically higher than the failure rate of students in 
other classrooms.
 Step 2: Set Confidence Level
 Unless otherwise stated in this book, the confidence level will always be 95 percent, or alpha = 0
.05.
 Step 3:
 Select Appropriate Test
 Our data takes the form of pass/fail, which is attribute or discrete data. We have one set of data that we 

are comparing to the hypothesized rate of failure of 20 percent. Given that information, the 1
-Proportion Test i
s the appropriate test.
 Step 4: Select Sample Size
 In this case, we aren™t worried about sample size because we have been provided with the data. Since 
Six Sigma teams usually gather their own data, they need to worry about the proper sample size. How to 
determine sample size is covered in the next chapter.
 Step 5: Run the Test and Analyze P
-Value
 The test is run in Minitab with the following information:
 - Number of trials: 142 (there are 142 students)
 - Number of events: 38 (there are 38 students meeting the 
event parameter ﬁfailﬂ)
 - Hypothesized proportion: 0.20 (20 percent of students in other classrooms meet the event 

parameter ﬁfailﬂ)
 - Alternative hypothesis: proportion > hypothesized proportion (we are testing whether the fail rate 
of students within the cla
ssroom is higher than the 20 percent fail rate of those outside the 
classroom)
 Given all of the information above, Minitab return
s a p-value of 0.031.

-value is less than the alpha value of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the 
alternative. 
Yes, the rate of failure is
 statistically higher for students in the classroom.
 1-Sample T Test
 Problem: An agriculture company growing corn produced an average of 168 bushels of corn per acre 
each year for five years. The company made a change to its seeding process in an attempt t
o increase 
the yield of its fields. The harvest following the seed change resulted in an average of 175 bushels of 
corn per acre each year over 500 acres of fields. The standard deviation is 2.2 bushels. Did the seeding 
change result in a statistically dif
ferent outcome in yield per acre?
 Step 1: State Null and Alternative Hypothesis
 H0: There is no difference in the mean yield after the seed change as compared to before the seed 
change.
 Ha: Following the seed change, the acres produce a statistically highe
r mean yield of corn.
 Step 2: Set Confidence Level
 Again, we set the confidence level for alpha at 95 percent, so alpha is 0.05.
 Step 3:
 Select Appropriate Test
 We are testing the mean of a sample against a hypothesized (or historic, or population) mean. A
ssume 
for the purpose of this example that our data is normal. The correct test would be the 1
-Sample T Test 
or the Z Test if we didn™t have the standard deviation.
 Step 4: Select Sample Size
 In this case, we aren™t worried about sample size because we hav
e been provided with the data. Since 
Six Sigma teams usually gather their own data, they need to worry about the proper sample size. How to 

determine sample size is covered in the next chapter.
 Step 5: Run the Test and Analyze P
-Value
 The test is run in Mi
nitab with the following information:
 - Sample size: 500 (there were 500 acres of corn fields)
 - Sample mean: 175 (following the seed change, the 500 acres yielded an average of 175 bushels)
 - Standard deviation: 2.2 (provided in our problem)
 - Hypothesized mean: 
168 (prior to the seed change, the average yield was 168 bushels)
 - Alternative hypothesis: mean > hypothesized mean (we are testing whether the average yield after 
the seed change is statistically higher than the yield prior to the seed change).
 Given all o
f the information above, Minitab return
s a p-value of 0.000.

For our purposes, it is zero. That means there is only a very

   2-Sample T Test
  Problem: Two attorneys practicing in the same law firm are turning in very different amounts of billable 
hours, even though the partners note that the two lawyers have similar caseloads. One p
artner 
hypothesizes that Attorney A™s legal staff is taking too long to handle some tasks; because the firm bills 
at a certain time for administrative

 To test the theory, data is gathered about the time legal staff spends on tasks. Specifically, a team looks 
at time spent on three tasks for which the legal staff is allowed to bill 15 minutes each: ce

compared to the time it takes Attorney B™s team. 
 Ha: Attorney A™s team takes on average longer to perform quarter

 St
ep 2: Set Confidence Level
 Again, we set the confidence level for alpha at 95 percent, so alpha is 0.05.
 Step 3:
 Select Appropriate Test
 We are testing the mean of one sample against the mean of another. For this problem, we will assume 
the data was tested
 to be normal. The data is time, so it is continuous. The appropriate test is the 2
-Sample T test. 
 Step 4: Select Sample Size
 In this case, we aren™t worried about sample size because we have been provided with the data. Since 
Six Sigma teams usually

  Since the p

The average time spent on the quarter

for 
each team. Minitab also calculates the means for us: Attorney A™s team spends an average of 13.76 
minutes o
n each task while Attorney B™s team spends an average of 12.82 minutes on each task. Both 
teams, in fact, spend less time on the tasks than they can bill for the tasks, which means neither team is 
technically wasting any time.
 One Sample Wilcox
 Problem: A
 real estate company wants to enter a high
-dollar market, so they want to build some 
regional websites that cater to homebuyers looking for larger homes. Specifically, they want to cater to 
homebuyers who are purchasing homes with 4 or more bedrooms. Befor
e the company can build 
websites and begin marketing, it needs to find neighborhoods where homes for sale typically have 4 or 
more bedrooms.
 The real estate company gathers information about the number of bedrooms in homes in a 
neighborhood. That data is p

 We are testing the median of a

  Hypothesis Testing in Analyze, Improve, and Control
  For Six 
Sigma teams, hypothesis testing is an activity typically found in the latter three phases of a 
DMAIC project, and most specifically in Analyze or Improve. During Analyze, teams might use hypothesis 

testing to help determine if certain inputs or factors cou
ld be a root cause. Given historical data, teams 
who can separate factors within a process can use that data to run a hypothesis test. For example, a 
team might believe that one employee is responsible for defects in a process. By comparing defect rates 
Page |

8 The Council for Six Sigma Certification. All rights reserved.
 wh
en that employee is on shift to defect rates when the employee is not working, teams can draw 
conclusions from data.
 During Improve, hypothesis tests are often used to validate solutions that are being tested in beta 
environments or in small batches. The t
eam compares the results of that solution with previous data 
about the process to determine whether the solution has created a statistically different result 
Œ and 
whether that result is what the team wanted. 
 Because hypothesis tests can begin to sound ve
ry mathematical, it™s important to start with a business
-friendly statement and end with a business
-relevant statement regarding the conclusions. Chapter 24 
covers some tips for converting various Six Sigma and statistical conclusions to business
-friendly 
presentations and knowledge, which is especially helpful when a Six Sigma team is proposing changes 

based on statistical analysis. The ability to conve
rt that analysis into business
-friendly language helps 
teams explain to 
decision
-makers why a change is l
ikely to help.
 A Review of Hypothesis Testing Terms
 This chapter introduced a lot of new statistical terms, many of which will come up again in future 
chapters. Before moving to the next chapter, take a few minutes to review the terms that came up in 
this chapter.
      Null Hypothesis: 
The assumed hypothesis; the statement that nothing has changed or no statistical 
difference exists. This is like the innocent verdict in a criminal court: it is assumed unless evidence
 tells us otherwise.
 Alternative Hypothesis
: The statement that something has changed or is statistically different 
Œ can 
be framed as not equal, greater than, or less than. If evidence means rejecting the null hypothesis, 
then the alternative hypothesis i
s assumed to be true.
 Alpha
: The measurement of the risk of a Type I error 
Œ the error that occurs if the null hypothesis is 
rejected when it was actually true.
 Beta
 Œ The measurement of the risk of a Type II error 
Œ the error that occurs if the null hypot
hesis is 
not
 rejected when it was actually false.
 Test Statistic 
Œ A standard value that is used to calculate the p
-value to determine whether to reject 
the null hypothesis. For example, in the T test, the value is ﬁtﬂ. We didn™t calculate or discuss these
 values in detail, but they are shown in Minitab™s output screen and can be valuable for more 

advanced statistical calculations. When using Minitab for hypothesis testing, the p
-value is 
automatically generated.
 P-Value
: The number typically used to compar
e to the alpha value to determine whether or not to 
reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p
-value is less than the alpha value.

 Chapter 22: Sample Size
  Accuracy in inferential statistics requires that you have the right sample size. A retail company with 
thousands
 of customers would never make a major product decision based on feedback from five 
people, and Six Sigma teams should never make decisions based on statistical analysis when the sample 

size is not big enough to create an acceptable margin of error.
 To und
erstand the importance of sample size, we™ll first review some important notes about sampling as 
related to inferential statistics.
 Six Sigma teams take samples because they want to determine information about a population. With 
some exceptions, it is very
 difficult, very expensive, or impossible to run statistical calculations on the 
entire
 population of data. However, when we sample the population and draw inferences from those 
samples about means, proportions, or variances, there is always some risk of e
rror. Some level of 
uncertainty will always exist when we draw conclusions about a population from sample data. In many 
cases, a larger sample size helps reduce the uncertainty of our conclusions.
 The uncertainty associated with sampling is defined by some
thing called the Confidence Interval, which 
is also called the margin of error in some applications. You™ve likely read or seen survey or poll results 
reported with a margin of error: The fans are 93 percent in favor of the new team colors, +/
- 2 percent. 
The margin of error in that particularly survey was 2 percent, or 0.02.
 In chapter 21, we discussed hypothesis testing and we set our alpha value at 0.05, which means we 
were at least 95 percent confident in choosing to reject or not reject the 
null hypothesis. We can make 
our hypothesis tests even more accurate by defining power and sample size for our data 
Œ particularly 
when we are pulling the data ourselves and can choose how many samples to take.

 A Review of Hypothesis Testing Errors
 The 
concept of hypothesis testing errors is key to selecting sample sizes for various hypothesis testing. 
The two types of errors were introduced in Chapter 21, but warrant a quick review before moving on 
with sample size calculations.
 Type I Error
 A Type I er
ror occurs when you reject the null hypothesis during a hypothesis test when, in fact, the null 
hypothesis is true. You might reject the null hypothesis that the mean of the sample is statistically the 
same as the hypothesized mean, deciding instead that t
he sample mean is statistically greater than the 
hypothesized mean. If the sample mean is, in fact, statistically the same as the hypothesized mean, you 
have a Type I error.
 Type I error risks are denoted by alpha.
 As stated in chapter 21, the Type I error
 is also called the producer risk. In a manufacturing environment, 
if the null hypothesis is true but it is rejected due to a Type I error, then material that is within 
specification (material that is statistically the same as the target) will be rejected.
 This is a producer risk 
Œ it causes waste, extra cost, and lower employee morale. 
 Type II Error
 A Type II error occurs when you accept the null hypothesis when it is, in fact, not true. If you accept the 
hypothesis that the sample mean is statistically t
he same as the hypothesized mean when, in fact, the 
sample mean is statistically greater than the hypothesized mean, then you have a Type II error.
 Type II error risks are denoted by beta.
 As stated in chapter 21, the Type II error is also called the consu
mer risk. In a manufacturing 
environment, if the null hypothesis is false but it is accepted anyway due to a Type II error, then material 

that is 
not
 within specification (material that is 
not
 statistically the same as the target) is accepted. That 
means product that doesn™t meet target is passed onto the consumer. 
That 
is a consumer risk 
Œ it could 
cause returns, unsatisfied customers, poor brand reputation. 
 The appropriate sample size can re
duce the risk of either type of error.
 What Information is Required for Choosing Sample Size?
 To perform sample size calculations 
Œ or have Minitab perform them for you 
Œ certain information and 
assumptions are required.
 Alpha
 The alpha level you set 
Œ rem
ember, the default in Minitab is typically set at 0.05
 Beta
 The beta level can be set by the experimenter and a sample size calculated from 
that number. If the sample size is fixed, then the experimenter usually sets alpha 
and calculates the beta risk 
from the sample size.
 Delta
 The practical difference the experimenter wants to detect using the test.
 Standard 
deviation
 The estimated population standard deviation.

 Type of Data
 Discrete or continuous?
 Type of Test
 Which 
hypothesis test are you using 
(see Chapter 21 for selecting the right test)
  Before you can move onto calculating sample size, some practical considerations must be made with 
regard to alpha, beta, and delta. In our review of Type I and Type II errors, we covered the difference 
betwee
n producer and consumer risks, but that breakdown doesn™t work in all organizations or with all 
hypothesis tests. 
 Because the outcome of your hypothesis tests are going to be used to make real
-world decisions, you 
have to truly understand what the test an
d its outcomes means for the business, employee, and 
consumer. That real
-world understanding helps you set appropriate Alpha and Beta values. 
 Questions to Ask About Alpha, Beta, and Delta Values
 In most cases, you can set the alpha value at 0.05. However,
 in specific experiments, accuracy is 
extremely important. In medical or drug trials, for example, alpha values could be set to 0.99 or 0.999, 

making it very unlikely that a researcher would accept an alternative hypothesis (that a drug caused a 
change, fo
r example) if it was not correct.
 When selecting alpha, Six Sigma teams should ask:
 - What are the costs associated with an unnecessary change if the team makes a mistake in rejecting 
the null hypothesis?
 o In a manufacturing environment, what are the costs wi
th rejecting materials that 
actually fit specifications?
 o In a non
-manufacturing environment, what are the costs associated with accepting the 
hypothesis that change did occur?
  Are there dangers or costs associated with concluding that a statistical change 

occurred? What are they?
 When selecting a beta value, Six Sigma teams should ask:
 - What is the potential costs of a Type II error if the team makes a mistake in 
not
 rejecting the null 
hypothesis?
 o What is the potential damage or cost if defective materials a
re passed to the customer? 
If a defective spoon is passed along, the ultimate cost might be minimal compared to a 
defective piece of medical equipment or car engine.
 o Are there costs associated with lost time or resources in correcting a problem that 
comes 
from a Type II error?
 When selecting a value for delta, Six Sigma teams should ask:
 - How small does the difference have to be before it becomes practically insignificant to the 
customer? In a pizza restaurant, for example, a customer who orders a 14
-inch pi
zza is going to 
care if he or she receives a 12
-inch pizza. If the pizza that is delivered measures 13.9 inches, the 
customer is unlikely to care.

 - What is the smallest delta that provides the best chance at exposing all benefits or information 
but 
is not s
o small as to be unfeasible. Working at smaller delta values means larger sample sizes or 
smaller measurement requirements, which take time to gather.
 - Ultimately, Six Sigma teams should ask themselves: what margin of error is tolerable in results
? The 
type
 of test you are running, the decisions you are making, and the processes you are dealing with 
help you make this determination. 
 The delta, or critical difference, should always be based on business needs. It is helpful in Minitab to 
express the delta in 
terms of sigma, or standard deviation. We want to detect differences of .5 
 or 2
 , 
for example. 
 Guidelines for Setting Various Numbers When Calculating Sample Size
 While values for various factors in sample size calculations should be guided by the busi
ness needs and 
purposes of the test, here are some guidelines Six Sigma teams can follow for baseline values or if no 
other information or needs are present.
 When Testing Means for Continuous Data
 If you have some information about the population, includin
g standard deviation: 
 - Set alpha at 0.05.
 - Set beta at 0.10 or 0.20 (which will give you a power of 0.90 or 0.80 
Œ a power of 0.90 is less likely to 
produce a Type II error than a power of 0.80, but it will also require a much larger sample size in 
most cas
es).
 - Set delta with absolute values as required by business needs or, more often in Minitab, as a 
function of standard deviation (.5
 
 
 
 When Testing Variance for Continuous Data
 - Set alpha at 0.05.
 - Set beta at 0.10 or 0.20 (which will give yo
u a power of 0.90 or 0.80 
Œ a power of 0.90 is less likely to 
produce a Type II error than a power of 0.80, but it will also require a much larger sample size in 

most cases).
 - Set delta greater than 1 and according to business needs, or, more often in 
Minitab, as a function of 
standard deviation (.5
 
 
 
 -   When Testing Proportions for Discrete/Binomial Data
 If you have some information about the population, including standard deviation: 
 -  Set alpha at 0.05.
 - Set beta at 0.10 or 0.20 (which w
ill give you a power of 0.90 or 0.80 
Œ a power of 0.90 is less likely to 
produce a Type II error than a power of 0.80, but it will also require a much larger sample size in 
most cases).
 - Set delta logically according to business needs, or, more often in Min
itab, as a function of standard 
deviation (.5

  Note:
 General sampling on an unknown population, also called survey sampling, requires a different 
approach to sample
-size calculation. Typically, you begin by setting alpha to 0.05, beta to
 0.5, and delta 
to a proportion in keeping with a standard deviation of 1. This provides an initial sample size so you can 
better understand the population, but you might have to do additional sampling based on the statistics 
calculated from your first sam
ple.
 Sample Size Calculations: Choosing the Right Method
 Just as there were numerous hypothesis tests to cover a range of data types and questions, there are 
numerous sample size calculations 
Œ all of which can be performed in Minitab. Review the list bel
ow to 
determine what type of calculation to perform when determining sample size for various hypothesis 
tests.
 1-Sample T Test Sample Size Calculation
 - Means testing
 - Comparing to a target value
 - You already have sample statistics about the population
 1-Sample Z Test Sample Size Calculation
 - Means testing
 - Comparing to a target
 - You do not have sample statistics about the population (standard deviation is not known)
 2-Sample T Test Sample Size Calculation
 - Means testing
 - Comparing means from two sets of data
 2-Sample Variance Test Sample Size Calculation
 - Variance testing
 - Comparing variance from two sets of data
 1-Sample Variance Test Sample Size Calculation
 - Variance testing
 - Comparing variance of one data set to a target

  Running and Analyzing Sample Size Tests in Minitab
 To understand more 
about running and analyzing sample size tests in Minitab, we™ll walk through the 
process for most of the test types above.

 First, let™s look at the 
1-Sample Z power and sample size calculation. Remember, you would use this 
calculation in conducting survey sampling for means testing, especially if you don™t know the standard 
deviation for the process or population. This calculation provides you with a 
ﬁjumping off pointﬂ 
Œ a sample size that provides you some relevant information that is as accurate as you define and that you 
can use as a basis for future sampling.
 Selecting the 1
-Sample Z calculation from the menu brings up the following dialogue box.
  Minitab lets you calculate sample sizes or back into power values if a sample size is fixed, which is why it 
asks you to fill in only two of the three first values.
 Because we don™t yet know much about our data, we leave sample size blank and provide sev
eral 
parameters for differences and power values for Minitab. This causes Minitab to provide a number of 

answers 
Œ one for each difference and power value combination 
Œ so we can make a more viable 
decision about sample size.
 In this case, we™ve set the di
fferences at .5
 
beta to either 0.2 or 0.1 respectively). Standard deviation for this first pass is assumed to be 1; if we had 
information about standard deviation, we could run a more precise calc
ulation or use the 1
-Sample T 
Test calculation.
 If you click options, you can change the confidence level or alternative hypothesis (to a greater or less 

than scenario).

 In this case, we™re leaving the options as is.
 After we click OK on the Power and S
ample Size box, Minitab returns the following information.
   Power and Sample Size 
  1-Sample Z Test   Calculating power for mean = null + difference  
              Sample  Target 
Difference    Size   Power  Actual Power        0.5      32     0.8      0.807430        0.5      43     0.9      0.906375 
       1.0       8     0.8      0.807430 
       1.0      11     0.9      0.912556        2.0       2     0.8      0.807430        2.0       3     0.9      0.933727   The data table returned by Minitab shows us the required sample size for each difference and target 
power. You can see that for the lowest difference and highest target power, the sample size required is 
only 43. 
But to determine a difference of 1
   at a target power of 0.9, you only need 11 in the sample 
size.
 Here, the team has to make a business
-centric decision. Perhaps samples are easy and inexpensive to 
capture, so the team selects the maximum sample size. B
ut if each sample takes an hour to obtain and 
costs the company $26, then the team might make the call to select a smaller sample size.
 Again, it is important to note with this particular test that more sampling might be required to draw 

further conclusion
s.  Sample Calculations for a 1
-Sample T Test
 To see the 1
-Sample T Test sample calculation in action, let™s revisit a problem from Chapter 21. 
 An agriculture company growing corn produced an average of 168 bushels of corn per acre each year for 
five year
s. The standard deviation is 2.2 bushels.  The company made a change to its seeding process in 
an attempt to increase the yield of its fields. Did the seeding change result in a statistically different 
outcome in yield per acre?
 How many acres would the co
mpany need to sample to determine if the new process made a 
difference? This could help the company know how many acres to plant with the new seed process.

 To generate data for this problem, select the 1
-Sample T calculation from the Power and Sample Size 
menu in Minitab.
  For this calculation, enter the differences as a multiple of standard deviation, the power values as 
desired, and the standard deviation provided in the data.
  Change the alternative hypothesis to greater than. The company wants to dete
rmine whether the yield 
of the new process is greater than the average yield of the old process.
 After you click OK, and then OK again, Minitab generates the following set of information.

 target 
power of 0.9 and be able to discern differences of 0.5 standard deviations. That™s a lot of acreage to 
plant with an experimental seeding process. The company might weigh its options and resources and 
decide, instead, to plant 43 or 32 acres. By pl
anting 43 acres, the company can detect differences as low 
as one standard deviation at 0.9 target power. Given that the standard deviation is assumed to be 2.2 
bushels, that is still a relatively small detection range, and the company saves a ton of money
 by 
planting over 100 fewer acres for the test.
  Backing into target power
 What if the agriculture company didn™t have a choice regarding the number of acres it could plant for a 
test? Finances, resources, or corporate leadership might collude to decide th
at the test could be run on 
a total of 18 acres 
Œ and only 18 acres.
 Minitab can take the information about the test and calculate the target power. The test is run the same 

way, but sample size is entered and power values are left blank.

   Power

0.5
 
Œ beta.  In this case, beta (the risk of making a
 Type II error) is 
over 0.75. 
 
Œ approximately 4.4 in this case 
Œ the power is extremely 
high. The team in this case would likely conclude that planting on the 18 sample acres would provide an 
appropriate sample f
or running the hypothesis test.
  Sample Calculations for a 1
-Sample Proportion Test
  Proportion tests are a bit different for two major reasons:
 - Proportion tests are run using attribute data. Attribute data almost always requires a larger sample 
size for a
ccurate results than continuous data does.
 - Because you are dealing with attributes 
Œ and rates 
Œ you don™t need to provide any information 
about population parameters such as sigma levels or standard deviation.
 To calculate the sample size required for acc
urate 1
-Sample Proportion hypothesis testing, you simply 
set alpha and beta and enter the proportions for both the null and alternative hypothesis. 
 Let™s consider a real
-world example to better understand the calculations in Minitab.
 A grocery store chain
 discovers it has a problem with prices being entered correctly into the system 
when product is placed in the store or prices are updated. In population sampling, the store found that 
approximately 8 percent of the prices are entered incorrectly. The store
 provided ½ of the employees 
who do pricing entry with new scanners to attempt to mitigate the problem. Before the store commits 
to a full
-time lease on the new equipment for all employees, it wants to confirm that the new scanners 
bring the error
-rate dow
n by 5 percent 
Œ to 3 percent or less.

    Select the 1
-Proportion calculation from the Power and Sample Size menu in Minitab. The comparison 
proportion is entered as 1 
Œ the probability of failure for a single trial. In this case, 1 
Œ 0.03, since the 
company wants to reduce the error rate to 3 percent.
 The hypothesized proportion is entered as 1 
Œ the probability of a failure for a single trial, or 1 
Œ 0.08, 
since the original process had an 8 percent failure rate. 
   Under options, select ﬁgreater th
anﬂ as the alternative hypothesis.
 Click OK and then OK, and Minitab generates the information seen below.

  Sample Size Calculations for a 2
-Sample T Test
 Consider again the 2
-Sample T test problem from the last chapter:
 Two attorneys practicing in the same law firm are turning in very different amounts of billable hours, 
even though the partners note that the two lawyers have similar caseloads. One partner 
hypothesizes 
that Attorney A™s legal staff is taking too long to handle some tasks; because the firm bills at a certain 

time for administrative
-style tasks regardless of how long those tasks take, if legal staff is taking too long 
for such tasks, they are 
spending time on work that can™t be billed for.
 To test the theory, data is gathered about the time legal staff spends on tasks. Specifically, a team looks 
at time spent on three tasks for which the legal staff is allowed to bill 15 minutes each: certain t
ypes of 
simple administrative phone, copying, or filing tasks. The following data is collected.
 Minutes Spent on Quarter
-Hour Tasks

But is that enough to provide a strong conclusion in the 2
-Sample T Test? 
 First, let™s look at the sample size calculations given what we know of the da
ta in question. The standard 
deviation of the data is 5.83, and we want to test whether the mean for Attorney A™s team is greater 

than the mean for Attorney B™s team. We would set up a 2
-Sample T Test in Minitab as pictured below.

us that answer.

 Before mov

sampling. Even if you perform a calculation to determine an appropriate sample size 
Œ and you choose 
to ere on the side of caution by sampling at the largest count size 
returned by Minitab 
Œ you can draw 
the wrong inferences because the sample was not random.

 Chapter 23: Advanced Control Charts
 The concept of control charts was introduced in the DMAIC chapter on control. Chapter 17 provided 
instructions for creating a 
specific type of control chart 
Œ the x
-bar chart 
Œ in Excel if you don™t have 
access to other statistical software. If you remember that section, you™ll remember it took many steps 
and some basic graphical formatting to create a full
-fledged x
-bar control 
chart. That™s not something a 
Six Sigma expert wants to go through every time leadership wants to see an update on a process, and 
certainly not something day
-to-day analysts want to do for regular reporting.
  Luckily, Minitab offers more automated x
-bar co
ntrol charting. The statistical software also offers easy 
access to other types of control charting. After the chapters on hypothesis testing and sample size 
calculations, it should come as no surprise that there are many types of control charts, each of w
hich are 
useful in monitoring different types of data and processes. In this chapter, we™ll look at the different 
types of control charts and when to use them before defining terms for each type of chart and walking 
through creating the charts in Minitab.
 Common Control Chart Types and When to Use Them
  X-bar & R Chart
 - Data is variable (continuous)
 - Data can be grouped into subgroups, letting you chart the mean of each group
 o Production mean per hour
 o Average answer speed of phones per hour
 o Average number of 
customers each day
 o Defects per hour
 - Data count in each subgroup is less than 8 (although you can use the x
-bar & R chart for subgroup 
sizes up to 100 in Minitab)
 - Presents two charts
 o The x
-bar control chart plots the mean of each subgroup
 o The R chart plots 
the range

 - Data is discrete
 - Data is presented as a percent (percent defective) rather than a count
 - Doesn™t require a constant sample/subgroup size
 - Plots the 
proportion of units that are nonconforming (are defective, don™t meet specifications)
 - Use when:
 o it is impossible, very 
time

numerical measurements
 o sample or subgroup sizes are not equal, so the p
ercent of defect is more important that 
the number of defects per group (as you can™t compare numbers in a smaller group with 
numbers in a larger group accurately)
 o data is rate
-based because it comes from a binomial or attribute process: the 
measurement or
 process is pass/fail, go/no go, etc. You can™t plot 1 or 0 on a control 
chart, but you can plot the percent of 1 or 0 in each sample.

   Creating and Reading Control Charts in Minitab
  X-Bar & R Charts or X
-Bar & S Charts
 To better 
understand the X
-Bar & R Chart process in Minitab, consider a real
-world scenario. A call 
center is tracking the number of calls on hold. The calls center randomly records the number of calls on 
hold at a given moment five times each hour. That data is pre
sented below for a 10
-hour shift.

   Test Results for R Chart of Calls On Hold 
  TEST 1. One point more than 3.00 standard deviations from center line. Test Failed at points:  2  You can see above, the control chart for the range failed at point 2 
Œ one point is beyond 3 standard 
deviations from the center line. All other points are within control parameters, and the sample mean (x
-bar) chart is also within control. That means that
 the average number of calls on hold within each hour 
was controlled. However, without hour 2, the specific data points ranged much more than in other 
hours, which means one or more samples collected was very high. 
 Someone viewing this chart would not lik
ely consider the process to be completely out of control, but 
they would want to investigate the samples for hour 2. What happened to make a drastic change in the 
range? Was a number recorded incorrectly? Did several employees take short, unplanned breaks 
that 
caused a sudden increase in calls on hold? Control charts can point to small problems such as these 
before they become bigger, systemic problems.

 I-MR Chart
  The I
-MR (individual and moving range) chart is used when you aren™t grouping data into subgroups. 
Either it isn™t feasible to gather enough samples for subgrouping or it is importa
nt for some reason to 
view the chart at the data
-point level.
 For example, a medium
-sized car dealership wants to measure the number of sales closed on a daily 
basis. Most car dealers aren™t closing hundreds of sales a day, so tracking per hour or in batch
 sizes 
won™t provide much information for data in a single month. If looking at a year™s worth of data, the 

dealership might subgroup by week; otherwise, the I
-MR chart is a good option.
 To work along with this example, copy the sales data below into Minit
ab.

 Test Failed at points:  16  In this particular c
ase, the number of sales per month, which is depicted on the top individual chart, are 
within control. 
The moving range 
Œ how much change there is between the number
s for each day 
Œ is in 
control except for point 16. 
If you look at the data, you see that b
etween point 16 and point 17, there is 
an 8
-sale difference. This is the point with the biggest difference in day
-to-day data points, which likely 
accounts for the test failure. 
 A car dealership or Six Sigma team working with this data would probably not 
be too concerned about 
that one point. When you consider it in practical terms, it could be that some sales that might have 
begun the day before didn™t close, which bumped up the day™s numbers artificially and caused the 
sudden wider
-than
-normal spread. In
 this case, the dealership or Six Sigma team would simply note the 
point and keep an eye on the control chart for similar test failures in the future that might indicate some 
type of pattern or problem with the process.
   P-Chart
   Remember, a p
-Chart is used to track attribute, rate data. It™s probably one of the most
-used attribute
-based control charts because rates are often easier to work with than actual attribute data, particularly 
because you don™t have to worry about ensuring
 the same sample or subgroup size. You can also 
combine multiple types of defects in the same report, because p
-charts are typically concerned with 
whether the product, part, or test passed or failed 
Œ not with the specifics about the defects that caused 
the pass or fail. 
 The type of data that is reported at a management level also tends to be complemented by the p
-Chart 
characteristics. Executive leadership often want to know audit results, first
-run yields, scrap rates, or 
defect rates, all of which can 
be illustrated with p
-Charts. 
 Proportion data is usually one of the first available to Six Sigma teams 
Œ even before a Six Sigma team is 
associated with a process, many business operators and managers capture pass/fail type data. This 
means that a Six Sig
ma team might be able to create a first baseline control chart from proportion data 
and see rates improve as process improvements are made.
 To understand how to create a p
-Chart in Minitab, consider the following real
-world scenario. A 
professional printin
g company discovers a possible problem with a printing process used to print 
business cards. Customer are reporting high rates of defects. The company begins monitoring the 

process more closely, reviewing 100 samples daily to determine if there are any def
ects on each printed 

card. The results are recorded in the data table below.
 Copy this data into Minitab if you are following along with creating control charts.

tigate both the 
samples and the process to find out if there is an ongoing process problem or a sample
-specific issue 
here.

several times throughout this book that continuous, or variable, data is typically better for 
statistical analysis than attribute data, and thi
s is one example of a reason for that.

 The steps for creating other attribute control charts, including np, u, and c charts, are the same as those 
for creating the p
-char
t. Practice Interpreting Control Charts
 With Minitab, creating control charts simply requires following the steps outlined above and some 

practice determining which control chart is correct for the situation and setting up data for the control 
chart. The h
arder part is interpreting control charts to make valid business decisions or 
recommendations. In this section, you™ll review control charts for a variety of real
-world scenarios and 
practice interpreting them.
  Help Desk Ticket Process
 The technical suppo
rt desk in an office tracks the number of tickets opened and closed each hour. That 
data is found in the table below.
 Incoming 
Tickets
 Complete 
Tickets
 10 8 12 10 15 12 7 9 2 5 8 9 9 8 11 12 1 2 16 14 18 17 5 6 8 7 14 13 7 6 6 7 17 12 8 10 5 6  Management wants to know whether the help desk process is performing well given 
only 
this 
information. A Six Sigma expert can do a few things to provide a preliminary answer to management.
 First, you might create an I
-MR chart for the Complete Ta
sks data. Why use an I
-MR chart? We don™t 
have enough data to create an X
-bar chart, because we would only have a few subgroups. 
 Page |

 The I
-MR chart is shown below, and you can see that there are no control failures for either the moving 
range or the number of
 tickets closed per hour.
    Someone might point out, though, that a control chart of the number of tickets completed only tells us 
there isn™t a great deal of deviation in the amount of work completed each hour, and this is true. This 
control chart does 
not actually take into account the amount of work that came in each hour and 
whether the help desk was clearing that work.
 So, a Six Sigma expert might add another column to the data. This column keeps a running total of how 
many tickets at that point of t
he day remain open.

  TEST 6. 4 out of 5 points more than 1 standard deviation from center line (on one side of      CL). 
Test Failed at points:  8, 9, 10, 12  Numerous tests are failed at numerous points on the chart. Is this a bad thing? Not necessarily, given an 
understanding of the process. The first five points that fail do so because they are 
below the centerline. 
That means the process was leaving 
fewer 
tickets open per hour than might be expected. Several 
reasons could exist for such results:
 - The team was just especially efficient at closing tickets those hours.
 - The team received tickets that
 were abnormally easy to deal with and close during those hours.
 - The team closed tickets without really resolving them.
 - The team simply received 
fewer 
tickets to work on.
 The first two reasons are positive, and the third could point to a problem with the t
eam. The last reason 
could be positive or negative: Were there 
fewer 
tickets because everything was working better than 
normal, or was there a problem with the ticketing software?
 All of these questions are worth looking into 
Œ they not only tell the team 
whether the process is 
possibly 
out of control, but they also provide valuable business information.
 The next two points that are out of control on this chart are due to upward trend 
Œ something a help 
desk manager would not want to see. He or she would wa
nt to continue monitoring this chart to see if 
the process corrects itself or continues to trend upward.
 Running a Hypothesis Test
 Given all of this information, a Six Sigma expert might even run a hypothesis test to go along with any 

control charts. He or
 she might run a 2
-Sample T test to determine whether the team is closing on 
average the same number of tickets that are being opened. If the answer is yes, then the help desk is 
probably performing well. If the answer is no, then the team might ask ﬁhow m
any tickets on average is 
the help desk not closing?ﬂ
 The results of running the 2
-Sample T test in Minitab are seen below.

 Granted, with a sample size of 19, the chance of a Type II error is relatively high, but the p
-Value is also 
very strong in favor of accepting the null hypothesis that the mean is 
statistically the same between the 
data for opened tickets and closing tickets. Given this information, the Six Sigma team might accumulate 
more data before running another test to verify these results.
  Yarn Skeins
 At a company that produces yarn skeins f
or retail sales, each 244
-yard skein features a certain color or 
color pattern. The company allows slight defects in dye at a rate of 10 per 244
-yard yarn length before 
the skein is considered defective overall.
 A team has been tasked with controlling the 
quality of this process. This team reviews 10 lengths of 
sampled yarn each day before it is wound into a skein to determine the number of defects. Over several 
days, the team gathers data and creates a control chart to indicate whether its process is in co
ntrol.
 The team generates the following data table. 
 Skein

the same and the team is concerned with the number of defects, it 
chooses to create a c

  Test Results for C Chart of Defects Found 
  TEST 1. One point more than 3.00 standard deviations from center line. Test Failed at points:  2, 12, 21  Based on three points that fail the control tests, this process is not completely in control and should be 
reviewed.
  Call
-Center Compliance
 A banking call center monitors its employees for compliance with numerous federal regulations as well 
as internal
 policies and procedures. The monitoring comes from a quality assurance team who randomly 
listens to phone calls and records information about errors that team members might make when on 
the phone. Team members can make more than one error on each phone ca
ll; for example, a team 
member might forget to let the caller know the call is being recorded 
and not provide the caller with the 
right information.
 In a 10
-hour shift, the quality assurance team monitored calls each hour and created the following data 
tab

example. Reasons for inconsistent 
subgroups in this case could be that the number of calls received each 
hour vary and the quality assurance team only reviews a certain portion of calls. It could also be that 
some calls take longer 
Œ and thus take longer to review. Regardless of the reason
 for inconsistent 
subgroup sizes, it leads us to choose the u
-Chart, which is concerned with the number of errors per unit. 
In this case, that would be calculated by dividing errors by calls monitored, creating rate or proportion 

data so that the actual sa
mple size isn™t as important.
 When plugging data into Minitab to create this control chart, Errors are the Variables and Calls 
Monitored are the Subgroup size.
 Minitab generates the following control chart.

 You can see that no tests are failed, which 
indicates the process is in control. You™ll also note that the 
upper control limit seems to stair
-step all over the place. This is because each sample was a different 
size, so each upper control limit is calculated at a different value.
 What if call center
 management was especially concerned with a specific error?
 If call center management was concerned with PCI
-compliance (compliance with the regulations for the 
payment card industry), they might want to dig into the data to see information about the numbe
r of 
errors related to PCI
-compliance. They might ask the quality assurance team to check a box when 
reviewing a call to denote whether the call was compliant with PCI standards or not.
 The new data table is seen below.

   This chart is a great illustration of how an in
-control process can still be a problematic process. This 
process is in control, but four of the last five points are above the 0.10 proportion mark. That means 
that out of 10 samples, four ha
d a fail rate of 10 percent or more when it comes to PCI compliance. 
 In the banking world, PCI compliance issues can cost a great deal of money, which means banking call 
centers 
will 
want to see PCI compliance error rates as close to zero as possible. The
 process owner for 
this call center is likely to take action to reduce the mean proportion of this process, even though it is in 
control.
  Common Cause versus Special Cause Variation
 When selecting the control tests in Minitab, you™ll note that we selected
 to perform all tests for special 
causes. This lets Minitab know to perform all the tests for special cause variation 
Œ special cause 
variation is that which is caused by something outside of the normal expectations within a process.
 Any process is going t
o have some amount of variation. The normal variation within a process 
Œ the 
variation that is caused by the process itself 
Œ is called common cause variation. For example, a phone 
operator working at a call center is going to make an occasional speaking o
r typing error while 
performing job duties. That variation is accounted for on a control chart. However, an operator who is 
working too many hours, has a bad headset, or is new on the job might make more than the normal 
amount of errors. That abnormality i
s likely to show up on a control chart and it is explained by the 
special causes such as a malfunctioning headset.

   Additional Minitab Control Charts
 Minitab offers a variety of other control charts. We have covered the most commonly used control 
charts i
n this chapter, but highlight a few others briefly below.
 The I & MR Chart (Within/Between)
 Not to be confused with the aforementioned I
-MR (Individual Moving Range) chart, the I & MR 
(Within/Between) chart provides a three
-way chart that indicates variati
on within a group and between 
groups. You might use this chart when the variation between batches is high compared to variation 

within batches or when variation is not randomly distributed. For example, when working with a process 

that spans shifts, you mi
ght have subgroups within shift groups, and differences might appear between 
the shifts. 
 You can find this chart under Stat > Control Charts > Variables for Subgroups
 Exponentially Weighted Moving Average
 The EWMA chart delivers an individual and moving r
ange graph. This chart is rarely used in common 
statistical analysis, as it is difficult to work with. Most often, the EWMA chart is used when dealing with 

automatic data systems.
 Cumulative Sum
 The CUSUM chart deals with the cumulative sums of the deviati
ons of each sample as they relate to a 
target value. CUSUM is very adept at detecting a small shift from a target, particularly in a process that is 
in control. Like the EWMA, CUSUM is not a commonly used control chart for most business 

environments.

 Chapter 24: Applying Statistics to Business 
Applications through Six Sigma
   You aren™t done with statistics yet
but
, it™s a good idea to take a break from the numbers and 
analysis to 
revisit some fundamental concepts of Six Sigma.
 Throughout Unit 4 and 5, we™ve worked extensively with data and analysis, and it can be easy to get 
wrapped up in the numbers without remembering the business need. In fact, the more you learn 
about 
statistical analysis, the easier it is to get caught up in the challenge of the analysis and forget that the 
business is relying on you for answers about its own challenges. In this chapter, we™ll cover some 

obstacles you might run into when communic
ating your statistical findings to business employees and 
leaders. We™ll also talk about the importance of including statistics in business presentations and some 

tips for integrating statistics within those presentations.
 Common Challenges When Presenting
 Statistical Analysis
 Here is the first, and perhaps biggest, challenge faced by Six Sigma experts when delivering information 

from statistical analysis: Most people don™t care. Truly, unless your sponsor is a Six Sigma expert too or 

your leadership commit
tee is well
-versed in Six Sigma methods, the people you are presenting to don™t 
care about which hypothesis test you used or what your Chi
-Squared statistic or p
-value was. That isn™t 
to say that business leaders and others don™t care about the conclusions
 or results of your analysis, and 
they certainly care about the results of the project as a whole. But you have to find a way to present 
your information in a way that ties in with what they care about and doesn™t rely solely on statistical 
concepts and la
nguage.
 A second challenge is that general business staff and leaders are unlikely to have the same 

understanding of statistical analysis as a Six Sigma expert does. The Six Sigma presenter is then tasked 

with presenting data when the backup for the data m
ight not be understood. As a Six Sigma expert, you 
have to be able to explain 
why
 the team chose to move in a certain direction or 
how 
you know a process 
has improved, and not everyone is simply going to take your word that the p
-Value was appropriate for 
the decision you made. 
 A third challenge when presenting your analysis is that you can easily become distracted or derailed by 
the statistics without getting your business point across. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, if 
your sponsor or ano
ther member of your audience is knowledgeable about Six Sigma and statistical 
analysis, he or she might begin asking statistical questions instead of business questions. Why did you 
use the 1
-Proportion test? How did you choose the sample size? Do you real
ly think a beta of 0.2 is 
sufficient, or should you have gone with a beta of 0.1? 
 Some statistical questions might very well be valid. How 
did
 you choose the sample size? That might be 
something relevant to cover in a presentation so that the audience und
erstands what assumptions were 
made by the team and what risks were considered acceptable. On the other hand, if you™ve already 
done the analysis and made decisions based on sample size and hypothesis testing, then it™s a moot 
point on whether the power wa
s set correctly. One way to keep this type of derailment from occurring is

 to keep a sponsor with Six Sigma knowledge in the loop throughout the project
; that way
, he or she can 
provide input on such things in real time if desired.
 The other reason you mig
ht get lost in statistics when you are supposed to be presenting business
-relevant information is because your audience 
doesn™t
 understand the statistics, leading to the 
presentation becoming a statistics lesson. It™s important to walk the line between edu
cating the 
audience on necessary information regarding the Six Sigma process and providing an in
-depth discussion 
of statistical analysis. For example, you probably should ensure your audience understands what 
standard deviation is and why it™s important. 
You probably 
don™t
 need to explain all the types of 
hypothesis tests 
Œ or even, in some cases, that you used a hypothesis test at all.
 A final challenge in presenting statistical data is in a tendency to include too much information or too 

many examples. Y
ou have a box plot, a bar graph, a pie chart, a hypothesis test, and several calculations 
based on probability distributions. They all look good to you. They all say a little something different 
about the data. They should 
all
 go in the presentation, right
? Wrong 
Œ too many ways of illustrating the 
data overwhelms the audience. It™s also likely that the majority of people within the business won™t see 
the nuances in the data that a trained Six Sigma expert does, which means from their perspective, 
you™re si
mply showing the same data over and over.  It™s not an effective use of presentation space or 
meeting time.
 Why Include Some Statistics?
 Even with all the challenges discussed above, you shouldn™t leave statistics out of your presentation 

altogether. Wheth
er you are presenting findings at a Measure or Analyze tollgate review or you are 
presenting for final approval on improvements, statistics are what provides your conclusions or results 
credibility.  Incorporating your data into a presentation can be diffi
cult, but we™ve provided some tips for 
doing so in the next section.
 Tips for Creating Business
-Friendly Presentations
 If it™s important to include statistics for credibility, but many people in your business audience are likely 

not to follow the intricaci
es of the actual analysis, what do you do? This is actually where some of the 
biggest benefits of Six Sigma™s statistical process control come in. If you are working in a true Six Sigma 
environment, then you are never working only with the numbers. Remembe
r from Unit 1 that Six Sigma 

is 
more
 concerned with the business 
Œ and its goals and success 
Œ than it is with the data and the 
analysis. In fact, the analysis and data is only relevant in so much that it can be used as a tool to make or 
measure improvemen
ts to business processes.
 Because of this, the Six Sigma team should already be rooted in business terms and phrases. Consider 
the act of drafting the problem statement, which we covered in chapter 5. The 
problem 
statement 
combines statistical concepts wit
h business goals and needs 
Œ and it is a good reference point for 
anyone presenting Six Sigma information throughout and following a DMAIC project. If you aren™t sure if 
something should be included in a presentation, then ask yourself: does it relate to t
he problem 
statement or a solution for the problem statement? If not, then it™s probably not necessary to 
communicate or present in a general business environment. As you work with data and statistics, you 
might be surprised by how your interest in the num
bers grow. While interest in the numbers can lead

 you to valuable discoveries and conclusions, you do need to avoid the temptation to include data or 
conclusions in a presentation simply because you think they are interesting or ﬁcool.ﬂ 
 Other ways you can
 create viable business presentations when dealing with statistics and analysis 
include tailoring presentation to the audience, creating a story
-style narrative, keeping things short and 
simple, integrating appropriate pictures, and avoiding misuse of tech
nology, presentation, or statistical 
tools. 
 Understand the Target Audience
 When presenting or communicating about a Six Sigma project or statistical analysis, tailor the 
information to reflect your audience™s level of concern and knowledge. For example, c
onsider a Six 
Sigma Black Belt who is presenting during an Improve tollgate review meeting. The Black Belt is 
presenting to a leadership team, which includes the project sponsor. At least two members of the 

leadership team are also Black Belts 
Œ perhaps on
e is even a Master Black belt.
 Given this scenario, the audience is both invested in the information and capable of understanding 

many of the statistical concepts behind the decisions made by the Six Sigma team during the project. 
That doesn™t mean you sho
uld automatically include all of your data in the presentation 
Œ your audience 
is also busy. But it does mean you should anticipate at least a few questions about methodology or 
statistical analysis, and you can incorporate a few technical terms or results
 into your presentation 
without worrying about having to explain them. 
 When dealing with this type of audience, it™s often a good idea to create a presentation appendix. You 

can put your analysis, data tables, and even specific Minitab results in the appe
ndix, where they can be 
quickly displayed if a specific question calls for it. In situations that involve high costs or high risks, 
leadership teams are more likely to want to see the background analysis because they need to fully 
understand all assumption
s and risks before making a decision on the recommended improvements.
 In other situations, you might be called upon to present Six Sigma information or statistical findings to 
audiences that are less invested or who don™t have any background with statistic
s. Examples include 
presenting to general management or presenting the reasons behind changes to the staff in a 
department impacted by a Six Sigma process improvement. When this happens, it can be helpful to rely 

on graphical representations of your analys
is, particularly if the information you are trying to share is 
very apparent on a certain type of graph. 
 For example, a Six Sigma team in a government office has been task with improving the production of a 
workflow process that involves reviewing applica
tions for financial aid. The team has made 
improvements to the process and now compares the average hourly production rate of the process 
before the changes with the current average hourly production rate. To do so, they complete a 2
-Sample T Test to deter
mine whether the new data has a higher average mean than the old data. The 
Minitab results are presented below.
 Two

95% upper bound for difference:  -0.889 T-Test of difference = 0 (vs <): T-Value = -2.70  P-Value = 0.005  DF = 43  Knowing what you do about hypothesis tests and p
-values, you can see qu
ickly that we reject the null 
hypothesis and accept the alternative. Yes, the mean averages of the process have changed. It is, 
according to our statistical analysis, a more productive process.
 But can you just copy that Minitab data into a PowerPoint slid
e? Probably not 
Œ only a Six Sigma or 
statistical analysis expert is going to be able to make that connection between p
-value and real
-world 
conclusion.
 Consider the graphical image below.
  This is a box plot of the same data used to create the 2
-Sample T
 Test above, but it provides a friendlier 
version of the data for most business employees. You can quickly see that the process C2 has a higher 

rate of production than the process C1 
Œ even if you don™t know anything about box and whisper plots.
 It™s not e
nough to understand how the target audience is likely to interact with data and statistical 
analysis. When creating a presentation about your project or statistical data, you also need to 
understand what the target audience wants to know and how they need 
to know it.

  High
-level leadership typically wants to know whether the project was a success, how you know 
it was a success, what savings or gains can be expected, and how you are controlling the process 
to ensure the same issues don™t arise again.
  Process
 owners and employees close to the process should know all of the above, though you 
might have to broaden discussions about costs and savings to leave out sensitive data that could 
be included in an executive
-level presentation (such as assumptions about e
mployee pay). 
Process owners and employees are also likely to want to know more details about the specific 
changes to the process 
Œ why were such changes implemented and how does it impact daily 
workflow? Where leadership might be satisfied with a high
-lev
el process map, for example, 
process owners want to see more granular maps.
  Audience members from disparate departments are likely to ask questions that make sense 
from their perspective, so know who will be in a tollgate or other type of presentation meet
ing, 

and be prepared to answer questions specific to their world.
 o Compliance staff asks about adherence to regulations. Did the team consider 
regulations when making decisions? What happens when compliance required a 
decision that seemed opposite of where 
the statistical inferences led the team? Did the 
team calculate risks and costs associated with compliance failures, which are often 
greater than other process failures?
 o Accounting or finance staff asks about budget, revenue, and savings. Does the team 
hav
e a graph that shows results in a dollar format? What is the likelihood of saving over 
a certain amount? Can the team associate a dollar amount with various analysis, 

changes, or improvements?
 o Marketing, sales, and customer service staff are likely to ask 
about customer
-facing and 
customer
-centric information. How did the team gather the voice of the customer? 
What assumptions about the customer did the team make? When making process 

changes or analyzing data, how did the team consider the customer?
 You obv
iously can™t create a presentation that answers every possible question about your process, 
project, or statistical analysis. The presentation would be enormous and take much too long to present. 
It™s typically a good idea to keep a presentation under 10 t
o 20 minutes with plenty of time for 
questions, and your presentation time might be even more constrained depending on organizational 

business practices. So, you should always answer the biggest and most important questions about your 

improvements, project
, or DMAIC stage in the presentation and be prepared for other types of 
questions in the question and answer session (this is where an appendix can be helpful).
 Tell a Story with Text and Images
 Use PowerPoint or another presentation program to combine you
r information in a way that tells a 
story that the audience can understand and care about. Keeping your audience and the purpose of your 
presentation in mind, attempt to tell an overall story across your entire presentation while presenting 
ﬁminiature narr
ativesﬂ on each slide. 
 Consider the example slide below, which presents the 2
-Sample T Test information we used previously 
in this chapter. The slide tells a story with the placement of information, the inclusion of a graphic, and 
the question
-and answer 
format. This is an easy template that can be used in a majority of Six Sigma 
presentation slides, particularly when presenting statistical analysis or data.

 - First, ask a question as the title of the slide. Create a concise question, but try to write a 
stand
-alone 
question. The slide example doesn™t do a great job of that: what changes, what process, and what 
hourly rates are being discussed? In the context of an entire presentation, this isn™t a problem. 
However, you might want to pull a single slide ou
t for an email communication or training 
document 
Œ and executive leaders tend to pull out one slide or graphical image to communicate 
information about a sponsored project. A better title for this slide might be ﬁDid software changes 
to the Aid Applicatio
n Review workflow increase hourly production rates?ﬂ
 - Next, include an image that answers your question or provides additional information regarding the 
data or process. Pictures, graphs, and maps break up long blocks of text in a presentation, making it 

easier for the audience to digest. By presenting data in a variety of formats on one slide, you also 
capture the interest and understanding of a wider audience. Graphical representations of data 
often get the point across quicker and can help you tell a comp
lex data story in a small amount of 
time.
 - It can be a good idea to include some basic statistical information, such as a business
-friendly 
version of the null and alternative hypothesis. At the very least, everyone in the audience can 

understand that these
 two statements are what the team were evaluating, and only one of them 
can be true. Including the type of test run and the p
-Value is optional, but can be a good idea both 
for the team™s own reference and for informing sponsors or others who are also know
ledgeable in 
Six Sigma.
 - Finally, answer the question posed in the title in a short, text
-based conclusion. The conclusion 
should align with any graphical representation or statistical test data included on the slide. You 
should avoid presenting contradicti
ng data and conclusions on a single slide unless you have a 
specific reason for doing so and an explanation of why the contradiction is important.

 Not all questions require all elements of the above slide. Sometimes, it makes sense to provide the 
answer
 in concise text. For example, you might ask ﬁWhat problem is the team trying to solve?ﬂ The 
right content for that slide would be the problem statement as written in the Define phase.
 Sometimes, the only thing you need to include on the slide is a graph o
r chart. Consider the slide below.
  This slide asks what is causing defective orders to be sent out, and it answers the question with a Pareto 
chart. Even if someone is not familiar with the Pareto chart, it™s fairly obvious given the labels and data 
tha
t the issue creating the biggest number of defects is in product finishing. Someone who knows about 
Pareto charts could see within seconds that finishing errors and defective raw inputs account for over 60 
percent of the errors; if you add ﬁwrong product s
elected,ﬂ you account for 80 percent of the errors.
 Some Six Sigma tools, such as the Pareto chart, are easy to explain to audience members who don™t 
have a pre
-existing understanding of data analysis or Six Sigma. Given a minute or two of presentation 
time, you could sufficiently explain how the above char
t answers the slide™s question, and this is one 
reason Pareto (and other bar
-type charts) are popular in such presentations. 
 Be Clear and Concise
 No matter how you are presenting your data, make sure each slide 
Œ and each element on the slide 
Œ is 
clear a
nd concise. This means writing in active language as much as possible, avoiding long text 
explanation, and ensuring everything is spelled correctly and that you didn™t use the wrong word by 
accident. When including statistics in a presentation, it can be e
asy to make an incorrect word choice 
that changes the meaning of your entire statement. Simply saying ﬁgreater thanﬂ when you meant ﬁless 
thanﬂ or ﬁdecreaseﬂ when you meant ﬁincreaseﬂ can skew the information you are providing or make it 

confusing to your 
audience.
 Page |

 Clarity isn™t just a concern in word choice and sentence structure. You should also be concerned with 
how elements on your slide come together. Don™t put so much information on a single slide that words 
or images become unintelligible to the audi
ence. In some cases, you might need to ask a question and 
answer it over a series of slides. 
 Be cognizant of the fact that a projected slide image is never as clear as the image on your computer. 
Because of this, you should always avoid layering light fon
t or images over a light background or layer 
dark font or images over a dark background. Don™t minimize fonts to something as small as 12
-point just 
to fit all the information 
-- remember, your audience could be sitting feet away or yards away. You also 
do
n™t need to include every bit of information on a slide 
Œ the slide should act as the visual reference 
point for the audience while you add information verbally.
 The text and images you add directly to the slide shouldn™t be your only concern. You also nee
d to make 
sure text and images within graphs are as clear and concise as possible. Consider the two boxplots 

below.
  C2C114121086420DataBoxplot of C1, C2Page | 
366
  © 201

  The first boxplot, on its own, doesn™t provide much information to an audience. Someone who 
understands boxplots would simpl
y be able to
 tell that two things were being charted and that the 
average of one was higher than the average of the other. 
 The second boxplot is the same as the first, but the title and data labels have been edited. Now, you can 
see that the graph provides informatio
n about the application workflow. Specifically, the graph is 
illustrating the average production rates per hour for that workflow, and the new workflow process 
seems to be more productive than the old one. 
 Creating graphical analyses that tell a small sto
ry all on their own 
Œ with the help of data labels and titles 
Œ is important. First, as the Six Sigma presenter, labels provide 
cues 
that help you verbally explain the 
slide or graph. After several slides with similar
-looking graphs or charts, even you can
 get confused 
about what specific data you are talking about. Second, appropriate labels on such images let you reuse 
the image without the context of the presentation or slide. This means you waste less time and can 

reuse your work when communicating abou
t your project or data 
Œ effectively reducing muda of rework. 
Finally, you don™t have to worry as much about someone taking your data or analysis and 
misinterpreting it or getting the wrong idea from it. If graphs are properly labeled, then it is harder fo
r someone seeing the information outside of your presentation to draw the wrong conclusions. 
 You can also edit colors of data on charts in both Minitab and Excel, making it even easier for an 

audience to draw appropriate conclusions from the illustration.
 Consider the Pareto chart below. This is 
the same Pareto chart shown earlier in this chapter, but in this version, the top three categories are 
presented in red. The color change emphasizes those categories, which account for 80 percent of the 

errors, mak
ing it easier for the audience to draw the conclusion that these are the issues that the team 
will concentrate on.

   Don™t Misuse Your Tools 
 A final tip for creating business
-friendly presentations is: don™t misuse the tools, knowledge, and 
resources you
 have for creating a presentations or communicating ideas. 
 Don™t misuse PowerPoint, for example. Most audience members don™t want to see a 100
-slide 
presentation. Just because you can include it, doesn™t mean you should. Likewise, try to avoid animating 
every aspect of your presentation. Yes, there is a time for fade
-in or fly
-in, but the time is 
not
 every 
single bullet point or image. Use animations sparingly 
Œ if at all 
Œ for impact about very important 
conclusions or elements of your presentation. For t
he most part, a strong Six Sigma presentation should 
rely on clarity and data over gimmicks and animations.
 Don™t misuse Minitab or your other statistical analysis software. It takes mere seconds to perform 
certain tests or create graphs in Minitab, as 
you™ll see in the next Unit. Because of that, Six Sigma 

analysts and teams tend to accumulate a lot of versions of data. Treat Minitab graphs and analysis as 
you do PowerPoint animations. Use them as needed, but don™t use them because they are there. One 
good rule is no more than one graph or chart per slide or data
-related question. This forces you to 
choose the graph or chart that you feel most powerfully or appropriately illustrates your data. There are 

exceptions to this rule, and you might need to incl
ude two charts if one chart helps explain another or 
you are comparing information about data or multiple data sets.
 Don™t misuse your data analysis skills. Misuse of data analysis can come in two forms: either you make a 

data analysis error inadvertently 
or you force an analysis to fit a desired outcome or conclusion. The first 
step is more of an error than a misuse; you can avoid presenting such errors to others by double 

checking all conclusions and inferences and having someone else knowledgeable about 
Six Sigma review 
your analysis before you finalize a presentation. This is why many Six Sigma organizations have at least

 one Master Black Belt on staff 
Œ Black Belts and Green Belts can call on the Master Black Belt if they 
have analysis questions or simp
ly want to confirm they are on the right track with analysis.
 No one is infallible, and mistakes can happen. As a Six Sigma expert, however, you can never allow 
biases to force statistical conclusions that aren™t supported by the data. And you certainly sh
ould never 
cloud analysis by presenting it in a way that makes it hard for your audience to see the appropriate 
conclusion because you want them to draw another conclusion. For example, the trick used above to 
highlight a certain part of the Pareto chart w
ith color can be used inappropriately. You can draw 
attention to a certain part of a graph or bar chart with color, increasing the chance that the audience 
will conclude that the colored portion is of more relevance or more important than other data on the
 graph. While this is sometimes true, Six Sigma teams and presenters must be careful when using such 

tactics 
Œ only create this scenario when the data supports such 
an 
emphasis.
 Another example of creating bias in a presentation comes when you present anal
ysis information 
knowing the sample size was not big enough for strong conclusions, but you don™t make that known 

when you present the information. This can result in leadership or others making decisions based on 
your data without understanding the risks 
that the conclusions might be wrong.
 Similarly, if you run four types of test in Minitab and three support one conclusion while only a single 
test supports the conclusion the team originally wanted to present, you shouldn™t present only the 

results of the 
single test. Before presenting anything, you should review each of the tests to understand 
why there is a difference in one; you should also ensure that the tests you are using are appropriate for 
the data, question, and sample size at hand. If you verify 
the statistics are all correct, then you usually go 
with the conclusion supported by the greater number of tests.
 Don™t Let the Presentation Drive the Project
 Given the decision
-making processes and requirements in a corporate business world, presentations
 are 
a requirement of the DMAIC process. Six Sigma teams and experts are going to have to present their 

findings at some point, so presentation skills are something you do need to work on.
 That being said, it is important that you never let the need for a 
good presentation drive any part of the 

process. Six Sigma teams should never make decisions about data gathering, graphical analysis, process 

mapping, brainstorming, or any other Six Sigma function because they think it will be good or look good 
for the p
resentation. Instead, the presentation of information to the business must come 
after
 the work 
is done.
 This truth is relevant any time you are presenting information to the business or business staff 
Œ not just 
when you are standing in front of a conferen
ce room with a PowerPoint behind you. For example, Black 
Belts often communicate with sponsors or business leaders regularly during the course of a DMAIC 
project. Perhaps the team provides a daily email or a weekend update to the sponsor; whatever the 
mode
 of communication is, all of the tips in this chapter are relevant.
